              "'Has been involved in, I would love to hear about what he\\'s doing now. So as of the last interview,  was not in high school. That is still correct? Correct. No, he\\'s post high school. Just like to confirm. So did Adrian exit the school system since we last spoke in May? No, he was already out. Okay. So for this section, I\\'m going to ask you about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that Adrian attended since May 12th of this year in 2021. So first, I\\'d like to get an idea of how Adrian usually spends his time. We\\'re going to talk about the activities that he participates in during a typical week. So what does a typical week look like for Adrian? How has he been spending his time? Well, I\\'m going guess on some of this, because I\\'m at work during the day. So I\\'m not sure what he does when I\\'m at work. But from my understanding, what he does when I\\'m at work is, he\\'ll work out. I don\\'t think it\\'s as consistent as he says. No, I shouldn\\'t say that. He is very truthful when he works out, but the goal is five days a week. But he probably does it once or twice a week. He does that. He makes his breakfast from scratch. And what else does he do? He\\'ll get dressed. And we\\'re in this vegetable program, so we get fresh vegetables every Friday. So he\\'ll go and pick those up. And based on what he gets in the box, it\\'s kind of like that shelf program or whatever. He\\'ll look and search for recipes and try to create something with it. And then of course, he makes us lunch and dinner. He cleans up. Like I said, on Thursdays, he does all the floors in the house, sweep and mop. He\\'ll do his laundry. Once a month, he writes out his budget for his money. Excuse me. Keeps his room clean and tidied up, and works on his financial goals. And then we\\'re always working on something  comes up, like things that he would need to do to keep up a home. Okay. So now I\\'m going to list off different things. So it\\'s all about the activities in which Adrian is currently involved. So is he involved in post secondary education program? Not at this time. Great. Is he involved in a vocational training program or unpaid internship? No. An adult day program? No. A sheltered workshop? No. Working for pay with or without support? No. Okay. Just keep going? Working for pay with or without... I was repeating the question, processing it. You\\'re good. I kind of combined them, because one was working with pay with support, and then one was working for pay independently. Okay. Trying to save us a little time, but it may not have worked. No, that\\'s fine. I was just trying to process it. You are perfectly fine. Does Adrian volunteer in the community, or has he since the last time we spoke? No. So now we\\'re going to talk about the school programs that Adrian attended after high school. So this is going to refer back to May 12th, 2021. So you said he was not currently. It says, \"Is Adrian currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college, or university?\" So any school program since May 12th of 2021? No. Can you tell me about... I\\'m really sorry. I have to cough again. Thank you. Can you tell me about those jobs or programs beginning with the current or most recent job program, working back to the last? Is Adrian currently participating in any employment, vocational, or volunteering activities? No, he\\'s not. Okay. Was he participating in these activities before May 12th of this year? Vocationary services? Mm-hmm . Yes. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? That was after the pandemic, then they went to the virtual coaching. And so helping him with his interviewing skills, how do you look for job, and all of that stuff that I talked about earlier with the skills and things like that. And it was very helpful, but since he wasn\\'t actively looking for a job, they said they no longer could provide that support until he wants to get hired somewhere. Okay. Thank you for connecting that. I remember listening, but I just want to make sure that we\\'re thinking the same things. So some of the questions are repetitive, so thank you.'"

              " \"Speaker 1: ... wash, that's probably one of the more... He was there for a full semester, so. Speaker 2: Okay. That's good. So what was the name of the car wash, please? Speaker 1: It's at the school. It's a car wash that's at the school, yes. Speaker 2: By the way, my daughter started in CPS high school this year with a strike, and then all this. Her freshman year was just such a bust, you know? Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: I don't know if you have one that age. Okay. How many hours a week did he work at this job, the car wash? Speaker 1: It's probably about five hours a week. Speaker 2: Mm-hmm . And when did he start it, around what year, month, if you can remember? Speaker 1: Sophomore year, so that would be two years ago or a year ago. And he did it for a semester. So they go through rotations, so I want to say he did it last year for three months. I'm not exactly sure when in that rotation, so we can start at the beginning of the school year last year. Speaker 2: 2018 or '19, would you say? Speaker 1: '19. Speaker 2: Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm . And it lasts about three months usually? Speaker 1: Yes. Speaker 2: Okay. So then let's just say 9, 10 11, till Christmas, I'll just say, Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: Okay, great. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about what he did at the car wash? Speaker 1: Wipe the cars down, wash them, clean the wheels. I mean the whole nine yards, everything that they do at a car wash. Dried the car, I mean they had a full fledged car wash, so sprayed all the tires, vacuumed out the inside. Speaker 2: And then what kinds of supports? I mean, I'm sure that, because it was at school, they had a bunch of teachers there. Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: Do you know what the supports they would provide? Speaker 1: I'm sure they had at least one teacher and one staff or one paraprofessional. And then for the most part, the support got less and less as the time went on. But they still maintained the... They keep busy washing staffs' cars and things like that, so every day they kind of have something to do and a new job. And they wash them for a couple dollars. And then the money they get from that, it's used for supplies and whatnot, so. Speaker 2: So those staff get their cars washed all the time, huh? Speaker 1: Yep. I guess it's a perk over there at North. Speaker 2: I mean, oh my gosh. Speaker 1: Let your daughter know she joined the wrong team. Speaker 2: That's right. Okay. So do you think that the car wash was a good fit for his skills and interests? Speaker 1: No, I don't think he could have cared less either way. Speaker 2: Has there been any jobs that he's had so far with the program that he really got into? Speaker 1: No, he doesn't care one way or the other. He does what he's told and could take it or leave it. Speaker 2: Yeah. How about volunteering in the community? Do you do that at all during high school or has he done that? Speaker 1: I mean, we've passed out masks. We've done Autism Speaks. I mean, I'm always in the community, so, I mean being in the LSD, we're at every after school program. I'm at everything, and he's right next to me, whether he likes it or not, so. Speaker 2: Yeah. Okay. Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: Great.\",\n",
              " \"Speaker 1: No problem. Speaker 2: Great. Hey, Molly. That was quick. All right, thanks. Bye. Speaker 1: Bye. Speaker 2: So next we're going to do a brief sort of assessment of Nathan's vocational history or experiences, if he's had any. I didn't want to open it up while you were talking to Janice in case it bumped her off the computer program. That was very quick. All right. Nathan is still in high school, right? Speaker 3: He is. He'll be coming up on what would be his 12th grade year. So I'm going to talk too much, but basically I was concerned... I know we need to get him on tons of social security and do guardianship. And then, it's just a lot, lot , and it's like a big, scary deal for me. But I'm excited to see what the future will hold for him. Speaker 1: Yeah. And I'm hoping that maybe participation in this will help you feel less like it's overwhelming, just learning. Speaker 3: Yeah. I . Speaker 1: That's my hope for everyone, too. Has he ever worked during high school? Speaker 3: No. So he has a vocational skills class where they... I was telling Janice a little bit about that. They do things like work with the dish machine at school, wash windows. So once COVID started, he had a weekly task. And so the tasks were making his bed, washing a counter, washing windows, folding a t-shirt, and sweeping the floor. I think those were the five that they said they'd been working on so far. And, of course, there's also a kitchen skills class where they've been working through recipes. But he hasn't had any kind of job on his own. So around the house he had some basic chores, and things. Speaker 1: And the class that he does in high school, did he get any payment for that? Speaker 3: Not that I'm aware of. No. Speaker 1: More like a class, right? Unpaid. Speaker 3: Yeah. It was a class. Speaker 1: Great. And then, let me just make sure there isn't anything else I want to ask about. Oh, when he was doing the class, his last job, about how many hours a week on average was he doing tasks around the school? Speaker 3: I want to say... Gosh, I can't remember. I think it was like a once-a-week kind of thing. So I want to say like an hour a week. And maybe later on, I'm going to have to double check the of notes, but... Speaker 1: And when did he start working or taking this class? Was it the beginning of the school year? Speaker 3: I think this year or last year. I think freshman and sophomores, they don't tend to head over into the vocational school. And I think the FS, the junior, senior year. So I guess this year, probably. Speaker 1: This year? Okay. Speaker 3: I believe so. I could be wrong. Speaker 1: Great. Okay. And then when he was doing this job, did he receive support? Speaker 3: Yeah, they were prompting, I'm sure, and coaching. They sent home some YouTube videos and that was really helpful, because prior to COVID I didn't really know how they were handling it. So first they'd give a quick instruction and then have those students do it with some support, so. Speaker 1: That's great. To kind of keep it going, you mean, after COVID started? Sort of keep it...? Speaker 3: Yeah. So for the work-at-home packet of worksheets and whatever they sent, some video. I can send a link to you to show what they were, if that's helpful for you. Speaker 1: Oh yeah. That'd be great. Yeah. Speaker 3: Okay. Will do. Speaker 1: Great. And do you feel like this was a good fit, this particular class job, for Nathan's skills and interests? Speaker 3: I don't know. I'm sure it fit with his abilities. Trying to get him interested in anything work-like has always been a huge challenge because he likes to do more recreational type of things. And so that's always been a little bit of a challenge. And he'll work at something, but just for a very brief time and then he's ready to be all done. So building the stamina for work is something that's definitely an area where we need to grow. Speaker 1: Great. Okay. And does Nathan volunteer in high school, anywhere in the community? Speaker 2: No, not really. He does help me out by playing with his little brother and things like that, but no community-based volunteer work. Speaker 1: Okay, great. Thanks. That's it for that one. All right. I'm actually going to quickly just...\",\n",
              " \"Speaker 1: Okay. I'm guessing not as well, because usually if you have one, I don't think you have the other SSI. Does he get VOC rehab services? David: Does he get what kind of rehab? Speaker 1: Vocational VR services, vocational rehab? David: I believe he gets those type of services through his schooling. He doesn't get any outside vocational service. Speaker 1: Okay. Do you feel he needs outside vocational at this time? David: I think it would be extremely helpful. I mean, our goal, I mean, Chandler's a great worker in general and takes a lot of pride in doing a good job. So we're very hopeful that he could find some good employment just because he got some really good skills. But he definitely needs some assistance in getting into the job and getting specifically going through it. So yeah, I think that's something he would benefit from immensely. Speaker 1: Does he get any Medicaid waiver services? That's not health insurance, that's extra services provided if you get pulled from the puns list, so that would be like a- David: He is on puns. And that's a good question. I know just from a medical insurance standpoint, Ann's insurance has historically covered him. I know we've talked about getting him on whatever Medicaid, Medicare, whatever that is, but I don't know that Ann has done that. So that's a good question. When she comes back to join us, we might circle back on that. She'll have a specific answer for you. Speaker 1: And you said you are on the puns list though, but he haven't been pulled?  David: Yes, we do. Speaker 1: Hold on one second. Do you get any services from being on that or you haven't been pulled yet? David: Anne uses that funding for respite care and in home she has an in-home caregiver that primarily works with Stewart, who's our other child of special needs. That funding is typically paid for, for that as well as some other Clearbrook Services NWSRA, Aftercare, programming that we have been involved in on and off. Speaker 1: Okay. You just answered so many of these already just in that one sentence. So thank you. Okay. Do you guys get any Medicaid long term services and supports? David: I do not believe so, but that may be one you want to confirm with Ann. Speaker 1: Okay. Well that's when somebody has sort of significant medical issues and you have a nurse or someone come into the home to administer medications. So... David: I'm not aware that we're doing that, but Anne, we're just talking about the services that they provide. So he has SSI he's he has puns funding, she asked some specific questions about Medicare and that kind of thing. So... Speaker 1: I asked about a Medicaid. Do you get Medicaid long term services and supports? Which is like in-home nursing and help. David: You're still on mute Ann. Ann: Sorry. We have Medicaid. It's Medicaid. We have that for him. And then when we're on the child waiver still with him, so we have to move him to the adult waiver in the next year or so. And when we do that, we have to make sure that all that other transfers over. Honestly, we've never used the Medicaid. I mean, it's there as a sort of backup, but I've got a really good insurance coverage, so that's our primary. So we haven't really needed to draw off the Medicaid, but it's there for him. Speaker 1: Do you all have a special needs trust or able account? Ann: Yes. Speaker 1: Does he have housing choice, voucher or food stamps? Does he get any of that with the government? Ann: No. Speaker 1: Are they currently needed? Ann: No. Speaker 1: I have to ask all the questions even if- Ann: Yeah, no, that's fine. Speaker 1: All right. So that's it for the government. Now the direct services, the rest of these are going to be additional direct services that he may or may not be getting. Does he get any speech or language or communication therapy or services? Ann: He gets a little bit in conjunction with school just in terms of what he needs help with in terms of his job, but not regularly like he would in a typical school environment. Speaker 1: Okay. And do you have to pay for those? Ann: No. Speaker 1: Okay. And how satisfied are you with those services? I know he doesn't get much. Would you say not at all, somewhat or very? Ann: I'd say somewhat. David: I would agree. Speaker 1: Does he receive audiology services for hearing problems? Ann: We have not done that in a long time. We've had it done in the past. He doesn't seem to have any hearing issues. I mean, if anything, he's got auditory defensiveness to some agree, but I don't think he has any specific hearing issues that we're aware of. Speaker 1: Okay. Does he need a reader or interpreter including sign language? Ann: No. Speaker 1: Do you feel that's currently needed? Ann: No. Speaker 1: How about assisted technology to help with his disability? Any kind? Ann: He doesn't have any. Whether or not it's needed, I think depends a lot on his vocational choices and decisions because if he needs technology to look something up, if he gets stuck or if he needs technology to help remind him how to do something, that might be a consideration. But day to day, I would say no. Speaker 1: Okay. Ann: Outside of his phone. Speaker 1: Does he get any orientation and mobility services that's for people with limited vision or  Ann: No. Speaker 1: Is it needed? No. Right. Does he need anything like that? Ann: No. Speaker 1: How about physical therapy? Ann: No. Speaker 1: And is it needed? Ann: Sorry. What's the last one? Speaker 1: Currently needed? Ann: No. Speaker 1: The physical therapy. Okay. Does he get any transportation because of his special needs? Ann: Transportation would be an issue like getting to and from events and things like that. He will never drive. I don't think he has an interest in driving and his... Speaker 1: Does he get any special services, like a bus that picks him up? Ann: Yeah. Speaker 1: He does? Ann: Yeah. Speaker 1: Okay. David: Oh yeah. Speaker 1: Do you have to pay for the transportation? Ann: That's through the school district. Speaker 1: And how satisfied are you with the service? Ann: Very satisfied. Speaker 1: Great. And I believe you said he does not get nursing care at home, right? Ann: Correct. Speaker 1: Okay. And does he need any nursing care? Okay. And David said you do have in-home aid? Ann: Yes. Speaker 1: Okay. And do you have to pay for the aid? Ann: I do. Well, let's put it this way, I have to pay for the aid, right now the child waiver is what pays for the aid. So I'm not sure exactly how that needs to be answered. But yes, I have to pay independently, but the state is basically paying for it. Speaker 1: Okay. And how satisfied are you with the service? Ann: I'm very satisfied with the service. The problem is, when Stuart turns 18 in four weeks, we are no longer eligible. And we've had pair of services for 21 years. And I have no idea how I'm going to be able to work and care for the children without a living assistant. And I don't even know the first place to go to find that. Speaker 1: Okay. I'm sorry. How about respite care? David mentioned that you do get respite care. Ann: We do have it available to us. We haven't been able to take advantage of it because Chandler's behaviors prevent him from participating. Speaker 1: Okay. Do you feel if you could get it, that it's currently needed? Ann: Yes. Speaker 1: Does he need any social work services? Ann: We don't get any right now. Speaker 1: Okay. Do you feel they're needed? Ann: I'm not sure what those services would look like, if it were something to help us facilitate his interaction with people and interaction in the community and things like that and how to help modify behaviors in public, I think that could be very helpful. Speaker 1: Okay. Does he receive any psychological or mental health services or one on one counseling? Ann: Yeah. Speaker 1: And do you have to pay for those? Ann: I do. Speaker 1: And how satisfied are you with the service? Ann: Satisfied. Speaker 1: And does he receive any medical services for any medical diagnoses or evaluations that are related to his special needs? Maybe like epilepsy, sleep issues, pretty much anything. Ann: Periodically, yes. I wouldn't say regularly, we just had a sleep discussion a couple of days ago with a sleep expert. So yeah, periodically we call them different professionals for different reasons. Speaker 1: Yeah. Right. And do you have to pay for that? Ann: I do. Speaker 1: You do. Okay. And here we go. How satisfied were you with the service? Ann: Satisfied. Speaker 1: And does he receive any training in independent living skills or occupational therapy? Ann: That's primarily through school. Because that's where they do sort of job training would be the closest to that. Speaker 1: Okay. Ann: And he received that through his school. Speaker 1: Okay. And how satisfied are you with the service? Ann: Very satisfied. Speaker 1: Very? Okay. Does he have any housing assistance or supervised group home? No. Right? Because he lives with the two of you. He lives in your two houses. Right? Ann: But he gets... David, what is it? The SSI that he gets monthly, he gets a stipend to support his living. So I don't know if that qualifies under that or if that's something different. Speaker 1: Okay. David: But he's not participating outside of our homes. Ann: No. David: Living. Speaker 1: Okay. And you mentioned he gets the job vocational training through the transition program at school. How satisfied are you with that service? Ann: I think it's great. David: Yeah, very. Ann: Very satisfied. Speaker 1: Okay. David: I wish we could continue with that after he ages out. Ann: Yeah. Speaker 1: Well, hopefully if you get a VR coach, if you get someone from vocational rehab, you can continue with a job coach? David: Yeah. Speaker 1: Do you get any financial aid to help pay for outside training or anything like that? Ann: No. Speaker 1: Okay. Do you feel it's needed? Ann: I don't think so, but I'm just not sure what training he might need that we haven't identified yet. But I would say, knowing what we know now, no. Speaker 1: Okay. Plus, he's getting it in school. David: Yeah. I would disagree. I would think that if he had access to funding and the coaching, he could probably be very productive in a work environment. But it would have to be very specific to the job. So for example, I think he's very capable of working in a manufacturing job or landscape services, there's a lot of different things that are task oriented that IO think he could do if he had some specific training. And one of the challenges in general is that people that are hiring for those kind of jobs, they're not equipped to take the extra steps to train and so forth. So having resources to have someone specifically do that, I think would be very beneficial for Chandler.And would help him transition into a better job situation for sure. Speaker 1: Okay, Great. Ann: I think that's absolutely fair. I think you're right. Speaker 1: Great. Does he receive any educational assistance or tutoring? Ann: Not at the moment. Speaker 1: Do you feel it's currently needed? Ann: I think he could benefit from it. I think if we could get him really reading where he enjoyed reading, I think that would be amazing. And I think he's capable. They did tell us in his school when he transferred over to the special ed school in high school, that he had the highest functioning academic ability of all the kids in the school and that he was going to be underserved because they wouldn't be able to get to his level to be able to challenge him enough. So we were aware of that. He couldn't function in a typical academic environment that was not going to work. And B, it just seemed the best for him in terms of behavioral modification, in terms of vocational focus and all of that, so it seemed to make more sense. But that said, I've always kind of regretted that I haven't focused more on his ability to read and expanding that and seeing if we couldn't get him to enjoy reading more and find more fulfillment there. Speaker 1: Okay. How about adult daycare or a day center, does he attend any of those? Ann: He did. There was, I don't even know if it was adult so much as like late teens, but there was a center that he would go to as a sort of an after school program. Speaker 1: Okay. Ann: We were generally not very satisfied with it. Speaker 1: All right. And did you have to pay for that? Ann: It was more of glorified babysitting. Yeah. David: Yes. Speaker 1: Does he have a case manager or someone who coordinates all the services that he receives? Ann: Yes. Speaker 1: And do you pay for the case management? Ann: Sorry. Speaker 1: Do you pay for the case manager? Ann: No. Speaker 1: And how satisfied are you with the services? Ann: Very satisfied. That's Paula, David. David: Right. Speaker 1: All right. Does he receive any other services I didn't mention because of his special needs? Ann: So for the child waiver, Clearbrook helps us with the self administration. So they're involved. So CAU is the one who does our case management and Clearbrook is the one who does our program and management for access. So those would be the... Speaker 1: Okay. And how satisfied are you with the Clearbrook services? Ann: Satisfied. I've had a lot of turnover, but the people we've been assigned have been good. Speaker 1: And is Chandler on a waiting list for any direct services, not the puns list, but any other types of direct services? Great. Thank you. That was this- Ann: No. Speaker 1: That's it for this assessment. And then we have one more about vocation and then Janice will hop on and talk about the goals. Just open this one up. Okay. Great. So Chandler is not still in high school, right? He's in a high school transition program. David: Correct. Speaker 1: Correct? Okay. While he was in high school, you mentioned, I'm going to ask you a little bit more about the jobs. So during high school, he did work. About how many jobs did he have? David: Quite a few, actually. I mean, he did at least between an in-school job and a community job. He would do two per semester. So for the last three to four years, there's probably been at least six or eight, I would think. Speaker 1: Okay. And they were part of high school programming? David: Yes. Speaker 1: Okay. And was he paid for those jobs? David: Yes, he was. Speaker 1: Because he's had so many and we don't want to actually write all of it down, could we talk about the one that he held the longest? David: Yeah. That was more of a function of scheduling than anything else. So they intentionally rotated him in and out of different jobs to expose him to different things. So probably the longest he had was at Walgreens. Speaker 1: Okay. David: No, he was doing that for a couple of semesters. Speaker 1: And the school provided or connected him up with that job? David: Yeah. And they provided a job coach and facilitated all the training and so forth. Speaker 1: And how many hours a week did he work at the job? On average, if you can remember. David: That's a good question. I believe it was a couple hour shift, probably two days a week, so four to six hours a week, I would think. Speaker 1: Okay. And do you remember when he began that job? David: Oh, geez. Speaker 1: Sorry. David: Probably 2018 it would've been. Yeah. I would think, let's call it October, November, 2018 and he did it the fall semester and spring semester. And then he also continued to do that probably the spring semester of the 2019 school year as well. Speaker 1: Okay. So he would end then around June of 2019? David: I would think so. Yeah. Anne, we're just talking about the longest job that he had. And I said, I would probably be with Walgreen because that was at least two to three semesters where he did that. So I'm guessing it was about October, November of 2018, to probably the spring semester, 2019. Does that sound about right? Ann: I might have it. Yeah. I might have, I think I put together a resume for him. Let me see if I've got it in there. Yeah. Sorry. So I just discovered one of the  of outdoor iPad, is that the iPad overheated, that's why it shut down. So I apologize. Speaker 1: Well, welcome back. Ann: Yeah. Sorry about that. So let me just look it up real quick. Go ahead with other questions. And I can probably look this up really quick. Speaker 1: So can you just give me some idea about what he did at the Walgreen's job? Job title, duties, whatever details it is. David: It was primarily stocking shelves, so restocking product on the shelves. Ann: And greeting. He did some customer greeting when they came in the store. Yeah. I do have a resume for him dated 2019. So give me one sec. It's just trying to open. Sorry, go ahead. Speaker 1: No problem. And what kinds of supports did the job coach provide on the job? David: I think one of the largest issues was just getting the product from the secure area. Walgreens obviously got areas where their product is very secure, so just getting banners on, racking and there would be... The product that he was stocking was primarily snacks and candy and that kind of stuff, more grocery type items as opposed to pharmaceutical items. So getting to those was inconsistent. They were held on racks and there was other racks in the way. So it wasn't like he would always go to the same place to get the product that he had to restock. Sometimes they were moved around in their storage area. So a lot of times the assistant or the job coach facilitated, just maneuvering product and other things out of the way so that he could get to the product that he was in charge of restocking Speaker 1: Thank you, that was helpful. What about transportation, how did he get to and from the job? David: School provided transportation. Speaker 1: Great. Do you think this job was a good fit for Chandler's skills and interests? David: I think he was very capable at it, so yeah. I mean, in general, I think most of the jobs he's had have been a good fit. So yeah, I would say yes. Ann: I think he was generally, I don't want to say overqualified, but I think it probably didn't... Stocking, I don't think challenges him all that much, but it does keep him on his feet, which he does like, and keeps him moving around, which he likes. So there are benefits to it, but I'd say my desire at some point is to balance an active job with a more challenging job. So like taking apart the keyboards is great, but he's sitting the whole time. So idea is we'd get two different jobs that would have different elements. Speaker 1: Okay, great. Did you find those dates? Did you want me to change them or? Ann: I did. And I realized that actually the resume is out of date. The most recent thing on there is 2017. So like David said, I think that Walgreen was '18 and '19. So that sounds like the dates are right. But I don't have the description on here. Yeah. Speaker 1: Okay. While he was in high school, did he volunteer in the community at all? Ann: He did volunteer sort of through school, but it was sort of part of the job stuff too. But I know he worked at a pet rescue place cleaning for a while, but as far as regular volunteer work, not that I'm aware of. Speaker 1: Thank you. Great. So that's it for the high school time. So the rest of the interview, we're going to just talk about what he's doing post traditional high school. What does a typical week look like him in terms of academics, possible volunteering and work? Ann: As of now? Speaker 1: Pre COVID. Pretend like normal time still exists. Ann: So he basically was in school every day from Monday through Friday, from nine until 2:30. And in school, they would do everything from the job placement. So he was working sort of four job shifts a week and two hours sort of shifts. So he worked four hours a week at a job plus transportation and everything came out a little bit more than that. They usually did at least one, I can't remember, what do they call it David? Like CPD or whatever it is, when they go out in the community. David: CBI. Ann: CBI, yeah. Community based instruction . So they'd go to a grocery store, they'd go to a McDonald's or something like that, so they'd do that about once a week. He would do different projects in school learning about the weather, learning about appropriate wear, things like that. Life skill type stuff. So that was sort of daily routine between 8:00 and 2:30. And then in the fall, he came home a couple of days a week and did the afterschool program, which we didn't think, again, it didn't seem to be engaging him. It was just sort of a place for him, which is not really what we wanted. And then after that, he had special gifts improvisation theater on Mondays after school, he had soccer on Tuesdays after school, he had basketball on Wednesdays after school and he had special gifts theater on Thursday after school. And then every other Saturday morning, we would have Pilates. And then on the weekends we were typically, we're kind of a on the go family, so we like to go hiking, we like to go biking, we like to go to museums, parks. So we're pretty outdoorsy and pretty on the go quite a bit. Speaker 1: Okay, great. Let's see. So how many hours would you say during the week? Not the social activities, but the vocational and the academic. How many hours a week would you say on average, does he spend doing those activities? I mean, are they contained between mostly nine to 2:30? Ann: Primarily, yes they were. Speaker 1: Okay. So let's see. So about 4, 9, 10. Okay. So four times five is 20. So about 22 hours a week, would we say, 22 to 24? Ann: Yeah. I would say yeah, 25 ish, because I want to make sure that we capture, that's probably what he was doing. I think there's a difference between what he was doing and what he's capable of doing, but yeah, I'd say probably 22 to 24 hours is probably about right. Speaker 1: Okay. Great. So I'm sorry. I just want to make sure I'm filling this out correctly. Ann: Yeah. Actually, if you look at it, well, because he was in school from nine to 2:30, right David? And then the bus brought him home. So the transportation was another half hour on either side of that. So if you take that, it's really somewhere around 27, 28 hours that he was really engaged in activities and then a half hour on either side with transportation. Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So I'm just going to see, hold on. I think that's my last question. I'm just double checking. I want to make sure I've got this before Janice hops on. Okay. I want to hear real quickly about the Job that he holds. If you could just kind of give me a quick rundown about how many hours a week he works in the job that you've mentioned a couple times, and then the duties that he has specifically. The one that you said he works at the recycling place. Ann: Yes. Speaker 1: Okay. So about how many hours a week? Ann: Right now, probably 10. I'd say roughly two hours a day. Speaker 1: Okay. And what is it called one more time please? Ann: It's called Eworks, E-W-O-R-K-S, I believe it is. Eworks, it's an electronics recycling company that was founded out of New York originally. And they're sort of a green initiative to make electronic waste more efficiently recycled. Speaker 1: Okay. And you mentioned that he takes apart keyboards. Is there other sort of tasks he does at that job? Ann: No. So that he's been doing at home. The ideal is, once COVID is kind of clear, that he will actually work in the factory itself, in the plant that they have here, but right now he's taking apart keyboards and he's also taking apart remotes, but remotes is removing the back, taking the batteries out, sorting the batteries and the remote itself and he can do each one in about 30 seconds. So the keyboards are a little bit more interesting and challenging. Like I said, I think he does somewhere around six or so an hour, with the keyboards and that's more interesting to him. So he's doing that at home right now. And we're just sort of putting in the number of days that he works. Speaker 1: When did he start that job? David: Couple of weeks ago, right? Ann: Yeah, just a couple of weeks ago. Speaker 1: Okay. Great. All right. So that would be June? Ann: I would say- Speaker 1: ... right now. Ann: Yeah. I'd say he started in May. It's been about four weeks, five weeks I think. Speaker 1: Okay, great. And do you feel that this is a good fit for him? Ann: I think it is. I mean, I think he likes it. Again, if he can do other things, like he can start taking apart the computer towers and things that have a little bit more sophistication, but he likes things that are project and task oriented, where he can see relatively immediate results, dishwashing, taking things apart, stuff like that. So I think that's very satisfying for him. So I do think that it's something he can stick with for a while. And the company is very... They've been working in the special needs community for a long time and they're very flexible on finding things to make it work. Speaker 1: Great. Okay. Anything else you guys want to add about vocational history before we move on to the goals? Ann: I don't think so. David, anything else? David: No. I mean, I think that covers it. I mean, definitely been exposed to a lot of different things from the pet care to Gus's Diner, to Walgreens, to now this disassembly work and also outside kind of just general labor kind of thing. So he's got really good skills and he's got a really good drive to do well. He just needs the right kind of training and supports to get him into the specific tasks of a job. And I think with those supports, he could be very successful in a lot of different things. Speaker 1: Great. And that ties into what we talked about with the services and maybe having some of the monetary support to get some specific job coaches in. Okay, great. I'm going to pause that.\",\n",
              " \"Speaker 1: That maybe you're not getting now. So hold on one second, I'm just pulling up... Speaker 2: Sure. Speaker 1: Okay. So, is Daniel still in high school? Speaker 2: No, he graduated last May. Speaker 1: Last May, okay. Speaker 2: They let him graduate, had graduation the day he aged out. Speaker 1: Okay. And did he ever work during high school? Speaker 2: No. Speaker 1: And did he volunteer at all during high school? Speaker 2: I think he lived in three different residential placements during high school, at least three. Some places they did sporadic volunteering, cleaning the old folks homes, gardens up and things, but that wasn't a routine that he went every week and volunteered somewhere. At the end, the last school, I don't know that he did any volunteering. I'm not sure. Speaker 1: Okay. So possibly an old folks home and maybe a couple different places here and there, depending on what school. Speaker 2: But pretty minimal. Speaker 1: Okay. All right. And how about work? Since high school has he worked? Speaker 2: He moved to the  in June sometime and about August that he started up at the KCTC. I always get those initials mixed up, maybe it's Kankakee Training Center, but there's two C's in it somewhere. Kankakee County Training Center. So he goes there since it took him a few months to get that worked out, but he goes every day except it's closed now, right? Speaker 1: So thinking about that, so he lives in the Silla when we're not in COVID times. He goes to the Kankakee County Training Center every day, about how many hours is he there? Do you know every day? Speaker 2: I think they leave the house at eight-ish and get back at 2:30. I'm not exactly sure how long the bus is. The bus takes them. Speaker 1: Okay. And this, is this a vocational, can you kind of tell me a little bit about the training center, what they do there? Speaker 2: I don't know that they've trained him to do anything. He counts things and puts them in bags, and then he's moved from that job. Sometimes when they have a lot of bags, he puts the bags in the boxes and sometimes he tapes the boxes. Those are the three things he's learned there. Speaker 1: Okay, great. And has he been in any post-secondary school programs since he left high school? Speaker 2: No. Speaker 1: Okay. And in terms of the work at the training center, is he paid for that? Speaker 2: Yes. He gets paid by check every two weeks. It's a piece, something about how many pieces... How much work they do... Count the bags or something. Speaker 1: Okay. Okay, Great. And How did he find this particular job? Speaker 2: The ResCare  the place, they have someone that gets them their job. I mean, they want them to have work and that was the one, I don't know. They took him there, they set it up. Speaker 1: Okay. Great. Speaker 2: All along with me saying I would really like him to have an outside kind of job, I mean, out in the community job someday. Speaker 1: Okay. So if we were to categorize this job, would you say that it's more of like a sheltered, segregated vocational- Speaker 2: Totally. Speaker 1: ... Job with other people with disabilities? Okay. All right. And so he sorts and puts things in bags and sometimes he puts the bags in boxes. Is there anything else you can tell me about the job that you know? Speaker 2: I don't, he said the pieces are different every time, the numbers different every time. Speaker 1: Okay. Speaker 2: He does understand the more he does, the more paycheck he gets, because he's had paycheck that range from $20 to $179... But he doesn't like to give me details. Speaker 1: Okay, Great. Thanks. And then any other comments about this job that you want to add? Speaker 2: The job that he has now? Speaker 1: Yeah. Speaker 2: He's not unhappy there. They have him in a smaller room. So anyway, there're other jobs he could learn there. They have many different kinds, but we'll see how that progresses. I don't know what they are. I really would like to go there someday and see the place, I never have. Speaker 1: Okay. Great. And has he participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since leaving high school? Speaker 2: No. Speaker 1: Okay. Great. All right. Now we're going to talk briefly about services. Let me see.\"]"

            "finishHas been involved in, I would love to hear about what he's doing now. So as of the last interview,  was not in high school. That is still correct? Correct. No, he's post high school. Just like to confirm. So did Adrian exit the school system since we last spoke in May? No, he was already out. Okay. So for this section, I'm going to ask you about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that Adrian attended since May 12th of this year in 2021. So first, I'd like to get an idea of how Adrian usually spends his time. We're going to talk about the activities that he participates in during a typical week. So what does a typical week look like for Adrian? How has he been spending his time? Well, I'm going guess on some of this, because I'm at work during the day. So I'm not sure what he does when I'm at work. But from my understanding, what he does when I'm at work is, he'll work out. I don't think it's as consistent as he says. No, I shouldn't say that. He is very truthful when he works out, but the goal is five days a week. But he probably does it once or twice a week. He does that. He makes his breakfast from scratch. And what else does he do? He'll get dressed. And we're in this vegetable program, so we get fresh vegetables every Friday. So he'll go and pick those up. And based on what he gets in the box, it's kind of like that shelf program or whatever. He'll look and search for recipes and try to create something with it. And then of course, he makes us lunch and dinner. He cleans up. Like I said, on Thursdays, he does all the floors in the house, sweep and mop. He'll do his laundry. Once a month, he writes out his budget for his money. Excuse me. Keeps his room clean and tidied up, and works on his financial goals. And then we're always working on something  comes up, like things that he would need to do to keep up a home. Okay. So now I'm going to list off different things. So it's all about the activities in which Adrian is currently involved. So is he involved in post secondary education program? Not at this time. Great. Is he involved in a vocational training program or unpaid internship? No. An adult day program? No. A sheltered workshop? No. Working for pay with or without support? No. Okay. Just keep going? Working for pay with or without... I was repeating the question, processing it. You're good. I kind of combined them, because one was working with pay with support, and then one was working for pay independently. Okay. Trying to save us a little time, but it may not have worked. No, that's fine. I was just trying to process it. You are perfectly fine. Does Adrian volunteer in the community, or has he since the last time we spoke? No. So now we're going to talk about the school programs that Adrian attended after high school. So this is going to refer back to May 12th, 2021. So you said he was not currently. It says, \"Is Adrian currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college, or university?\" So any school program since May 12th of 2021? No. Can you tell me about... I'm really sorry. I have to cough again. Thank you. Can you tell me about those jobs or programs beginning with the current or most recent job program, working back to the last? Is Adrian currently participating in any employment, vocational, or volunteering activities? No, he's not. Okay. Was he participating in these activities before May 12th of this year? Vocationary services? Mm-hmm . Yes. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? That was after the pandemic, then they went to the virtual coaching. And so helping him with his interviewing skills, how do you look for job, and all of that stuff that I talked about earlier with the skills and things like that. And it was very helpful, but since he wasn't actively looking for a job, they said they no longer could provide that support until he wants to get hired somewhere. Okay. Thank you for connecting that. I remember listening, but I just want to make sure that we're thinking the same things. So some of the questions are repetitive, so thank you.\n",
            "finish... wash, that's probably one of the more... He was there for a full semester, so. Okay. That's good. So what was the name of the car wash, please? It's at the school. It's a car wash that's at the school, yes. By the way, my daughter started in CPS high school this year with a strike, and then all this. Her freshman year was just such a bust, you know? Yeah. I don't know if you have one that age. Okay. How many hours a week did he work at this job, the car wash? It's probably about five hours a week. Mm-hmm . And when did he start it, around what year, month, if you can remember? Sophomore year, so that would be two years ago or a year ago. And he did it for a semester. So they go through rotations, so I want to say he did it last year for three months. I'm not exactly sure when in that rotation, so we can start at the beginning of the school year last year. 2018 or '19, would you say? '19. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm . And it lasts about three months usually? Yes. Okay. So then let's just say 9, 10 11, till Christmas, I'll just say, Yeah. Okay, great. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about what he did at the car wash? Wipe the cars down, wash them, clean the wheels. I mean the whole nine yards, everything that they do at a car wash. Dried the car, I mean they had a full fledged car wash, so sprayed all the tires, vacuumed out the inside. And then what kinds of supports? I mean, I'm sure that, because it was at school, they had a bunch of teachers there. Yeah. Do you know what the supports they would provide? I'm sure they had at least one teacher and one staff or one paraprofessional. And then for the most part, the support got less and less as the time went on. But they still maintained the... They keep busy washing staffs' cars and things like that, so every day they kind of have something to do and a new job. And they wash them for a couple dollars. And then the money they get from that, it's used for supplies and whatnot, so. So those staff get their cars washed all the time, huh? Yep. I guess it's a perk over there at North. I mean, oh my gosh. Let your daughter know she joined the wrong team. That's right. Okay. So do you think that the car wash was a good fit for his skills and interests? No, I don't think he could have cared less either way. Has there been any jobs that he's had so far with the program that he really got into? No, he doesn't care one way or the other. He does what he's told and could take it or leave it. Yeah. How about volunteering in the community? Do you do that at all during high school or has he done that? I mean, we've passed out masks. We've done Autism Speaks. I mean, I'm always in the community, so, I mean being in the LSD, we're at every after school program. I'm at everything, and he's right next to me, whether he likes it or not, so. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Great.\n",
            "finishNo problem. Great. Hey, Molly. That was quick. All right, thanks. Bye. Bye. So next we're going to do a brief sort of assessment of Nathan's vocational history or experiences, if he's had any. I didn't want to open it up while you were talking to Janice in case it bumped her off the computer program. That was very quick. All right. Nathan is still in high school, right? He is. He'll be coming up on what would be his 12th grade year. So I'm going to talk too much, but basically I was concerned... I know we need to get him on tons of social security and do guardianship. And then, it's just a lot, lot , and it's like a big, scary deal for me. But I'm excited to see what the future will hold for him. Yeah. And I'm hoping that maybe participation in this will help you feel less like it's overwhelming, just learning. Yeah. I . That's my hope for everyone, too. Has he ever worked during high school? No. So he has a vocational skills class where they... I was telling Janice a little bit about that. They do things like work with the dish machine at school, wash windows. So once COVID started, he had a weekly task. And so the tasks were making his bed, washing a counter, washing windows, folding a t-shirt, and sweeping the floor. I think those were the five that they said they'd been working on so far. And, of course, there's also a kitchen skills class where they've been working through recipes. But he hasn't had any kind of job on his own. So around the house he had some basic chores, and things. And the class that he does in high school, did he get any payment for that? Not that I'm aware of. No. More like a class, right? Unpaid. Yeah. It was a class. Great. And then, let me just make sure there isn't anything else I want to ask about. Oh, when he was doing the class, his last job, about how many hours a week on average was he doing tasks around the school? I want to say... Gosh, I can't remember. I think it was like a once-a-week kind of thing. So I want to say like an hour a week. And maybe later on, I'm going to have to double check the of notes, but... And when did he start working or taking this class? Was it the beginning of the school year? I think this year or last year. I think freshman and sophomores, they don't tend to head over into the vocational school. And I think the FS, the junior, senior year. So I guess this year, probably. This year? Okay. I believe so. I could be wrong. Great. Okay. And then when he was doing this job, did he receive support? Yeah, they were prompting, I'm sure, and coaching. They sent home some YouTube videos and that was really helpful, because prior to COVID I didn't really know how they were handling it. So first they'd give a quick instruction and then have those students do it with some support, so. That's great. To kind of keep it going, you mean, after COVID started? Sort of keep it...? Yeah. So for the work-at-home packet of worksheets and whatever they sent, some video. I can send a link to you to show what they were, if that's helpful for you. Oh yeah. That'd be great. Yeah. Okay. Will do. Great. And do you feel like this was a good fit, this particular class job, for Nathan's skills and interests? I don't know. I'm sure it fit with his abilities. Trying to get him interested in anything work-like has always been a huge challenge because he likes to do more recreational type of things. And so that's always been a little bit of a challenge. And he'll work at something, but just for a very brief time and then he's ready to be all done. So building the stamina for work is something that's definitely an area where we need to grow. Great. Okay. And does Nathan volunteer in high school, anywhere in the community? No, not really. He does help me out by playing with his little brother and things like that, but no community-based volunteer work. Okay, great. Thanks. That's it for that one. All right. I'm actually going to quickly just...\n",
            "finishOkay. I'm guessing not as well, because usually if you have one, I don't think you have the other SSI. Does he get VOC rehab services? Does he get what kind of rehab? Vocational VR services, vocational rehab? I believe he gets those type of services through his schooling. He doesn't get any outside vocational service. Okay. Do you feel he needs outside vocational at this time? I think it would be extremely helpful. I mean, our goal, I mean, Chandler's a great worker in general and takes a lot of pride in doing a good job. So we're very hopeful that he could find some good employment just because he got some really good skills. But he definitely needs some assistance in getting into the job and getting specifically going through it. So yeah, I think that's something he would benefit from immensely. Does he get any Medicaid waiver services? That's not health insurance, that's extra services provided if you get pulled from the puns list, so that would be like a- He is on puns. And that's a good question. I know just from a medical insurance standpoint, Ann's insurance has historically covered him. I know we've talked about getting him on whatever Medicaid, Medicare, whatever that is, but I don't know that Ann has done that. So that's a good question. When she comes back to join us, we might circle back on that. She'll have a specific answer for you. And you said you are on the puns list though, but he haven't been pulled?  Yes, we do. Hold on one second. Do you get any services from being on that or you haven't been pulled yet? Anne uses that funding for respite care and in home she has an in-home caregiver that primarily works with Stewart, who's our other child of special needs. That funding is typically paid for, for that as well as some other Clearbrook Services NWSRA, Aftercare, programming that we have been involved in on and off. Okay. You just answered so many of these already just in that one sentence. So thank you. Okay. Do you guys get any Medicaid long term services and supports? I do not believe so, but that may be one you want to confirm with Ann. Okay. Well that's when somebody has sort of significant medical issues and you have a nurse or someone come into the home to administer medications. So... I'm not aware that we're doing that, but Anne, we're just talking about the services that they provide. So he has SSI he's he has puns funding, she asked some specific questions about Medicare and that kind of thing. So... I asked about a Medicaid. Do you get Medicaid long term services and supports? Which is like in-home nursing and help. You're still on mute Ann. Sorry. We have Medicaid. It's Medicaid. We have that for him. And then when we're on the child waiver still with him, so we have to move him to the adult waiver in the next year or so. And when we do that, we have to make sure that all that other transfers over. Honestly, we've never used the Medicaid. I mean, it's there as a sort of backup, but I've got a really good insurance coverage, so that's our primary. So we haven't really needed to draw off the Medicaid, but it's there for him. Do you all have a special needs trust or able account? Yes. Does he have housing choice, voucher or food stamps? Does he get any of that with the government? No. Are they currently needed? No. I have to ask all the questions even if- Yeah, no, that's fine. All right. So that's it for the government. Now the direct services, the rest of these are going to be additional direct services that he may or may not be getting. Does he get any speech or language or communication therapy or services? He gets a little bit in conjunction with school just in terms of what he needs help with in terms of his job, but not regularly like he would in a typical school environment. Okay. And do you have to pay for those? No. Okay. And how satisfied are you with those services? I know he doesn't get much. Would you say not at all, somewhat or very? I'd say somewhat. I would agree. Does he receive audiology services for hearing problems? We have not done that in a long time. We've had it done in the past. He doesn't seem to have any hearing issues. I mean, if anything, he's got auditory defensiveness to some agree, but I don't think he has any specific hearing issues that we're aware of. Okay. Does he need a reader or interpreter including sign language? No. Do you feel that's currently needed? No. How about assisted technology to help with his disability? Any kind? He doesn't have any. Whether or not it's needed, I think depends a lot on his vocational choices and decisions because if he needs technology to look something up, if he gets stuck or if he needs technology to help remind him how to do something, that might be a consideration. But day to day, I would say no. Okay. Outside of his phone. Does he get any orientation and mobility services that's for people with limited vision or  No. Is it needed? No. Right. Does he need anything like that? No. How about physical therapy? No. And is it needed? Sorry. What's the last one? Currently needed? No. The physical therapy. Okay. Does he get any transportation because of his special needs? Transportation would be an issue like getting to and from events and things like that. He will never drive. I don't think he has an interest in driving and his... Does he get any special services, like a bus that picks him up? Yeah. He does? Yeah. Okay. Oh yeah. Do you have to pay for the transportation? That's through the school district. And how satisfied are you with the service? Very satisfied. Great. And I believe you said he does not get nursing care at home, right? Correct. Okay. And does he need any nursing care? Okay. And David said you do have in-home aid? Yes. Okay. And do you have to pay for the aid? I do. Well, let's put it this way, I have to pay for the aid, right now the child waiver is what pays for the aid. So I'm not sure exactly how that needs to be answered. But yes, I have to pay independently, but the state is basically paying for it. Okay. And how satisfied are you with the service? I'm very satisfied with the service. The problem is, when Stuart turns 18 in four weeks, we are no longer eligible. And we've had pair of services for 21 years. And I have no idea how I'm going to be able to work and care for the children without a living assistant. And I don't even know the first place to go to find that. Okay. I'm sorry. How about respite care? David mentioned that you do get respite care. We do have it available to us. We haven't been able to take advantage of it because Chandler's behaviors prevent him from participating. Okay. Do you feel if you could get it, that it's currently needed? Yes. Does he need any social work services? We don't get any right now. Okay. Do you feel they're needed? I'm not sure what those services would look like, if it were something to help us facilitate his interaction with people and interaction in the community and things like that and how to help modify behaviors in public, I think that could be very helpful. Okay. Does he receive any psychological or mental health services or one on one counseling? Yeah. And do you have to pay for those? I do. And how satisfied are you with the service? Satisfied. And does he receive any medical services for any medical diagnoses or evaluations that are related to his special needs? Maybe like epilepsy, sleep issues, pretty much anything. Periodically, yes. I wouldn't say regularly, we just had a sleep discussion a couple of days ago with a sleep expert. So yeah, periodically we call them different professionals for different reasons. Yeah. Right. And do you have to pay for that? I do. You do. Okay. And here we go. How satisfied were you with the service? Satisfied. And does he receive any training in independent living skills or occupational therapy? That's primarily through school. Because that's where they do sort of job training would be the closest to that. Okay. And he received that through his school. Okay. And how satisfied are you with the service? Very satisfied. Very? Okay. Does he have any housing assistance or supervised group home? No. Right? Because he lives with the two of you. He lives in your two houses. Right? But he gets... David, what is it? The SSI that he gets monthly, he gets a stipend to support his living. So I don't know if that qualifies under that or if that's something different. Okay. But he's not participating outside of our homes. No. Living. Okay. And you mentioned he gets the job vocational training through the transition program at school. How satisfied are you with that service? I think it's great. Yeah, very. Very satisfied. Okay. I wish we could continue with that after he ages out. Yeah. Well, hopefully if you get a VR coach, if you get someone from vocational rehab, you can continue with a job coach? Yeah. Do you get any financial aid to help pay for outside training or anything like that? No. Okay. Do you feel it's needed? I don't think so, but I'm just not sure what training he might need that we haven't identified yet. But I would say, knowing what we know now, no. Okay. Plus, he's getting it in school. Yeah. I would disagree. I would think that if he had access to funding and the coaching, he could probably be very productive in a work environment. But it would have to be very specific to the job. So for example, I think he's very capable of working in a manufacturing job or landscape services, there's a lot of different things that are task oriented that IO think he could do if he had some specific training. And one of the challenges in general is that people that are hiring for those kind of jobs, they're not equipped to take the extra steps to train and so forth. So having resources to have someone specifically do that, I think would be very beneficial for Chandler.And would help him transition into a better job situation for sure. Okay, Great. I think that's absolutely fair. I think you're right. Great. Does he receive any educational assistance or tutoring? Not at the moment. Do you feel it's currently needed? I think he could benefit from it. I think if we could get him really reading where he enjoyed reading, I think that would be amazing. And I think he's capable. They did tell us in his school when he transferred over to the special ed school in high school, that he had the highest functioning academic ability of all the kids in the school and that he was going to be underserved because they wouldn't be able to get to his level to be able to challenge him enough. So we were aware of that. He couldn't function in a typical academic environment that was not going to work. And B, it just seemed the best for him in terms of behavioral modification, in terms of vocational focus and all of that, so it seemed to make more sense. But that said, I've always kind of regretted that I haven't focused more on his ability to read and expanding that and seeing if we couldn't get him to enjoy reading more and find more fulfillment there. Okay. How about adult daycare or a day center, does he attend any of those? He did. There was, I don't even know if it was adult so much as like late teens, but there was a center that he would go to as a sort of an after school program. Okay. We were generally not very satisfied with it. All right. And did you have to pay for that? It was more of glorified babysitting. Yeah. Yes. Does he have a case manager or someone who coordinates all the services that he receives? Yes. And do you pay for the case management? Sorry. Do you pay for the case manager? No. And how satisfied are you with the services? Very satisfied. That's Paula, David. Right. All right. Does he receive any other services I didn't mention because of his special needs? So for the child waiver, Clearbrook helps us with the self administration. So they're involved. So CAU is the one who does our case management and Clearbrook is the one who does our program and management for access. So those would be the... Okay. And how satisfied are you with the Clearbrook services? Satisfied. I've had a lot of turnover, but the people we've been assigned have been good. And is Chandler on a waiting list for any direct services, not the puns list, but any other types of direct services? Great. Thank you. That was this- No. That's it for this assessment. And then we have one more about vocation and then Janice will hop on and talk about the goals. Just open this one up. Okay. Great. So Chandler is not still in high school, right? He's in a high school transition program. Correct. Correct? Okay. While he was in high school, you mentioned, I'm going to ask you a little bit more about the jobs. So during high school, he did work. About how many jobs did he have? Quite a few, actually. I mean, he did at least between an in-school job and a community job. He would do two per semester. So for the last three to four years, there's probably been at least six or eight, I would think. Okay. And they were part of high school programming? Yes. Okay. And was he paid for those jobs? Yes, he was. Because he's had so many and we don't want to actually write all of it down, could we talk about the one that he held the longest? Yeah. That was more of a function of scheduling than anything else. So they intentionally rotated him in and out of different jobs to expose him to different things. So probably the longest he had was at Walgreens. Okay. No, he was doing that for a couple of semesters. And the school provided or connected him up with that job? Yeah. And they provided a job coach and facilitated all the training and so forth. And how many hours a week did he work at the job? On average, if you can remember. That's a good question. I believe it was a couple hour shift, probably two days a week, so four to six hours a week, I would think. Okay. And do you remember when he began that job? Oh, geez. Sorry. Probably 2018 it would've been. Yeah. I would think, let's call it October, November, 2018 and he did it the fall semester and spring semester. And then he also continued to do that probably the spring semester of the 2019 school year as well. Okay. So he would end then around June of 2019? I would think so. Yeah. Anne, we're just talking about the longest job that he had. And I said, I would probably be with Walgreen because that was at least two to three semesters where he did that. So I'm guessing it was about October, November of 2018, to probably the spring semester, 2019. Does that sound about right? I might have it. Yeah. I might have, I think I put together a resume for him. Let me see if I've got it in there. Yeah. Sorry. So I just discovered one of the  of outdoor iPad, is that the iPad overheated, that's why it shut down. So I apologize. Well, welcome back. Yeah. Sorry about that. So let me just look it up real quick. Go ahead with other questions. And I can probably look this up really quick. So can you just give me some idea about what he did at the Walgreen's job? Job title, duties, whatever details it is. It was primarily stocking shelves, so restocking product on the shelves. And greeting. He did some customer greeting when they came in the store. Yeah. I do have a resume for him dated 2019. So give me one sec. It's just trying to open. Sorry, go ahead. No problem. And what kinds of supports did the job coach provide on the job? I think one of the largest issues was just getting the product from the secure area. Walgreens obviously got areas where their product is very secure, so just getting banners on, racking and there would be... The product that he was stocking was primarily snacks and candy and that kind of stuff, more grocery type items as opposed to pharmaceutical items. So getting to those was inconsistent. They were held on racks and there was other racks in the way. So it wasn't like he would always go to the same place to get the product that he had to restock. Sometimes they were moved around in their storage area. So a lot of times the assistant or the job coach facilitated, just maneuvering product and other things out of the way so that he could get to the product that he was in charge of restocking Thank you, that was helpful. What about transportation, how did he get to and from the job? School provided transportation. Great. Do you think this job was a good fit for Chandler's skills and interests? I think he was very capable at it, so yeah. I mean, in general, I think most of the jobs he's had have been a good fit. So yeah, I would say yes. I think he was generally, I don't want to say overqualified, but I think it probably didn't... Stocking, I don't think challenges him all that much, but it does keep him on his feet, which he does like, and keeps him moving around, which he likes. So there are benefits to it, but I'd say my desire at some point is to balance an active job with a more challenging job. So like taking apart the keyboards is great, but he's sitting the whole time. So idea is we'd get two different jobs that would have different elements. Okay, great. Did you find those dates? Did you want me to change them or? I did. And I realized that actually the resume is out of date. The most recent thing on there is 2017. So like David said, I think that Walgreen was '18 and '19. So that sounds like the dates are right. But I don't have the description on here. Yeah. Okay. While he was in high school, did he volunteer in the community at all? He did volunteer sort of through school, but it was sort of part of the job stuff too. But I know he worked at a pet rescue place cleaning for a while, but as far as regular volunteer work, not that I'm aware of. Thank you. Great. So that's it for the high school time. So the rest of the interview, we're going to just talk about what he's doing post traditional high school. What does a typical week look like him in terms of academics, possible volunteering and work? As of now? Pre COVID. Pretend like normal time still exists. So he basically was in school every day from Monday through Friday, from nine until 2:30. And in school, they would do everything from the job placement. So he was working sort of four job shifts a week and two hours sort of shifts. So he worked four hours a week at a job plus transportation and everything came out a little bit more than that. They usually did at least one, I can't remember, what do they call it David? Like CPD or whatever it is, when they go out in the community. CBI. CBI, yeah. Community based instruction . So they'd go to a grocery store, they'd go to a McDonald's or something like that, so they'd do that about once a week. He would do different projects in school learning about the weather, learning about appropriate wear, things like that. Life skill type stuff. So that was sort of daily routine between 8:00 and 2:30. And then in the fall, he came home a couple of days a week and did the afterschool program, which we didn't think, again, it didn't seem to be engaging him. It was just sort of a place for him, which is not really what we wanted. And then after that, he had special gifts improvisation theater on Mondays after school, he had soccer on Tuesdays after school, he had basketball on Wednesdays after school and he had special gifts theater on Thursday after school. And then every other Saturday morning, we would have Pilates. And then on the weekends we were typically, we're kind of a on the go family, so we like to go hiking, we like to go biking, we like to go to museums, parks. So we're pretty outdoorsy and pretty on the go quite a bit. Okay, great. Let's see. So how many hours would you say during the week? Not the social activities, but the vocational and the academic. How many hours a week would you say on average, does he spend doing those activities? I mean, are they contained between mostly nine to 2:30? Primarily, yes they were. Okay. So let's see. So about 4, 9, 10. Okay. So four times five is 20. So about 22 hours a week, would we say, 22 to 24? Yeah. I would say yeah, 25 ish, because I want to make sure that we capture, that's probably what he was doing. I think there's a difference between what he was doing and what he's capable of doing, but yeah, I'd say probably 22 to 24 hours is probably about right. Okay. Great. So I'm sorry. I just want to make sure I'm filling this out correctly. Yeah. Actually, if you look at it, well, because he was in school from nine to 2:30, right David? And then the bus brought him home. So the transportation was another half hour on either side of that. So if you take that, it's really somewhere around 27, 28 hours that he was really engaged in activities and then a half hour on either side with transportation. Okay. All right. So I'm just going to see, hold on. I think that's my last question. I'm just double checking. I want to make sure I've got this before Janice hops on. Okay. I want to hear real quickly about the Job that he holds. If you could just kind of give me a quick rundown about how many hours a week he works in the job that you've mentioned a couple times, and then the duties that he has specifically. The one that you said he works at the recycling place. Yes. Okay. So about how many hours a week? Right now, probably 10. I'd say roughly two hours a day. Okay. And what is it called one more time please? It's called Eworks, E-W-O-R-K-S, I believe it is. Eworks, it's an electronics recycling company that was founded out of New York originally. And they're sort of a green initiative to make electronic waste more efficiently recycled. Okay. And you mentioned that he takes apart keyboards. Is there other sort of tasks he does at that job? No. So that he's been doing at home. The ideal is, once COVID is kind of clear, that he will actually work in the factory itself, in the plant that they have here, but right now he's taking apart keyboards and he's also taking apart remotes, but remotes is removing the back, taking the batteries out, sorting the batteries and the remote itself and he can do each one in about 30 seconds. So the keyboards are a little bit more interesting and challenging. Like I said, I think he does somewhere around six or so an hour, with the keyboards and that's more interesting to him. So he's doing that at home right now. And we're just sort of putting in the number of days that he works. When did he start that job? Couple of weeks ago, right? Yeah, just a couple of weeks ago. Okay. Great. All right. So that would be June? I would say- ... right now. Yeah. I'd say he started in May. It's been about four weeks, five weeks I think. Okay, great. And do you feel that this is a good fit for him? I think it is. I mean, I think he likes it. Again, if he can do other things, like he can start taking apart the computer towers and things that have a little bit more sophistication, but he likes things that are project and task oriented, where he can see relatively immediate results, dishwashing, taking things apart, stuff like that. So I think that's very satisfying for him. So I do think that it's something he can stick with for a while. And the company is very... They've been working in the special needs community for a long time and they're very flexible on finding things to make it work. Great. Okay. Anything else you guys want to add about vocational history before we move on to the goals? I don't think so. David, anything else? No. I mean, I think that covers it. I mean, definitely been exposed to a lot of different things from the pet care to Gus's Diner, to Walgreens, to now this disassembly work and also outside kind of just general labor kind of thing. So he's got really good skills and he's got a really good drive to do well. He just needs the right kind of training and supports to get him into the specific tasks of a job. And I think with those supports, he could be very successful in a lot of different things. Great. And that ties into what we talked about with the services and maybe having some of the monetary support to get some specific job coaches in. Okay, great. I'm going to pause that.\n",
            "finishThat maybe you're not getting now. So hold on one second, I'm just pulling up... Sure. Okay. So, is Daniel still in high school? No, he graduated last May. Last May, okay. They let him graduate, had graduation the day he aged out. Okay. And did he ever work during high school? No. And did he volunteer at all during high school? I think he lived in three different residential placements during high school, at least three. Some places they did sporadic volunteering, cleaning the old folks homes, gardens up and things, but that wasn't a routine that he went every week and volunteered somewhere. At the end, the last school, I don't know that he did any volunteering. I'm not sure. Okay. So possibly an old folks home and maybe a couple different places here and there, depending on what school. But pretty minimal. Okay. All right. And how about work? Since high school has he worked? He moved to the  in June sometime and about August that he started up at the KCTC. I always get those initials mixed up, maybe it's Kankakee Training Center, but there's two C's in it somewhere. Kankakee County Training Center. So he goes there since it took him a few months to get that worked out, but he goes every day except it's closed now, right? So thinking about that, so he lives in the Silla when we're not in COVID times. He goes to the Kankakee County Training Center every day, about how many hours is he there? Do you know every day? I think they leave the house at eight-ish and get back at 2:30. I'm not exactly sure how long the bus is. The bus takes them. Okay. And this, is this a vocational, can you kind of tell me a little bit about the training center, what they do there? I don't know that they've trained him to do anything. He counts things and puts them in bags, and then he's moved from that job. Sometimes when they have a lot of bags, he puts the bags in the boxes and sometimes he tapes the boxes. Those are the three things he's learned there. Okay, great. And has he been in any post-secondary school programs since he left high school? No. Okay. And in terms of the work at the training center, is he paid for that? Yes. He gets paid by check every two weeks. It's a piece, something about how many pieces... How much work they do... Count the bags or something. Okay. Okay, Great. And How did he find this particular job? The ResCare  the place, they have someone that gets them their job. I mean, they want them to have work and that was the one, I don't know. They took him there, they set it up. Okay. Great. All along with me saying I would really like him to have an outside kind of job, I mean, out in the community job someday. Okay. So if we were to categorize this job, would you say that it's more of like a sheltered, segregated vocational- Totally. ... Job with other people with disabilities? Okay. All right. And so he sorts and puts things in bags and sometimes he puts the bags in boxes. Is there anything else you can tell me about the job that you know? I don't, he said the pieces are different every time, the numbers different every time. Okay. He does understand the more he does, the more paycheck he gets, because he's had paycheck that range from $20 to $179... But he doesn't like to give me details. Okay, Great. Thanks. And then any other comments about this job that you want to add? The job that he has now? Yeah. He's not unhappy there. They have him in a smaller room. So anyway, there're other jobs he could learn there. They have many different kinds, but we'll see how that progresses. I don't know what they are. I really would like to go there someday and see the place, I never have. Okay. Great. And has he participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since leaving high school? No. Okay. Great. All right. Now we're going to talk briefly about services. Let me see.\n",
            "finishI'm glad to hear that. That's big . Distracted. He had a half day today, and so I'm kind of waiting for his bus to get back at the same time. Oh no, no. Absolutely. That's the priority here, so totally fine. I'm looking like, \"Is he back yet?\" Yeah. Okay. So in this next portion, just wanting to confirm, and I believe you shared, he is in high school right now. Is he currently working? So at this point, he doesn't have an official job, but they're starting to do... Last year before COVID they started doing some basic job training. And then once he got back into school, they returned to that. What's different now is they seem to be taking it more out of the building for jobs. They used to do internal things like washing school windows, wiping down desks, working with the dish washing machine. Now they have them in the community a little bit more, with his class studies. And now where they'll go to a local restaurant and wipe down the tables, go to the local library and clean the DVD's, that kind of thing. So the location has changed a little bit where they're working, but it's not an official job with a salary yet. There he is. Did you just share that he's just getting off the bus? Do you want to pause? We can pause if you'd like. Oh, okay. Sure. Perfect. Has Nathan worked and left any jobs since May 10th of 2021? No, not yet. And has he volunteered in the community during high school, since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. So this next.\n",
            "finishI'm back. Here we go. So, first off, we're going to talk about her high school experience. So can you describe Grace's high school situation at the moment in terms of when she's going to graduate? The things that you told me before, but more specifically. When exactly is she finishing and moving into the transition program? She'll graduate in May and the transition program, I assume will start in August. Okay. She was held back one year, and so she won't have quite as much time, I think, in the transition program as most of her peers would. Okay. And did Grace's high school track or plans change since we last spoke? No, I don't think so. The only thing that changed was when COVID started, she had just been accepted into the Ambassadors Club, which is the club that helps... so the reason she was accepted into Ambassadors Club is because they were going to start training her as an usher in our giant theater auditorium. Only the Ambassadors Club are trained as ushers and the reason they were going to start training her as ushers, because we put that in her IEP, that is something that she would love to do for a job, since she likes musical theater and music so much, and all that did not happen and won't happen before she leaves high school, unfortunately. That was kind of a bummer because being in the Ambassadors Club, evidently is very difficult. They take one out of, I don't know, I couldn't remember the number, they'll only take one out of 50 students that apply, and she was getting some special treatment based on the fact that we talked about a very specific reason for her to be in the Ambassadors Club. This school was being amazing about saying, \"This is a good thing that we can do\". We were looking forward to that whole experience, but like I said, didn't happen. That's too bad. I'm sorry. Now you know. Yeah, now I know, but still it's a bummer, right? Yeah. We'll figure out other ways, hopefully. If she still wants to get some usher training, maybe there's another avenue for that. And when is she planning on exiting high school altogether? That's including the transition program. Can you give me an idea what year that would be? I would say when she turns 22, and they kick her out. She will turn 22 in March of 2024. Okay. The next part we're just going to look at high school employment, and we talked about earlier she's not currently working. Yes. And then it's prompting me to ask why? Is there something else besides COVID? Or can you tell me a little bit about work plans for Grace? I guess, I don't see a reason for her to start working until after she's had as much training as we could possibly give her, and she really hasn't had that training yet. So I would say if there's an opportunity for her to have some supported facilitated type employment through her transition program, then we would be okay with that. But she doesn't have any burning desire to just get out there and get a job anyway. She wants to work at some point, but I don't know that any of us feel she's properly trained for any job right now. Sorry, my giant dog is drinking water loudly next to us. Wonder what that is. It's okay. I have a giant dog too. Everything he does makes a lot of noise. Has she volunteered in the community during high school since the last time we spoke? No, not since the last time we spoke. She's done it in the past, but not since we spoke because she doesn't go out . She always is- One month between when we had our meeting and when there was a lockdown, even at that, so she's not really done anything since our meeting. Got it. And then is there anything else you want to share that we didn't talk about? Any updates since last year? I mean, I can't really think of anything else that's happened. Other than the stuff we mentioned, no, I don't think there's anything. Great, okay. Well, before we say goodbye, first off, thank you for taking time to talk to me today. We couldn't do this without you guys, and this is really helpful. So before we say goodbye, we're just verifying everyone's address and email and the... Hold on. Let me stop the-\n",
            "finish... Modified curriculum based on my advocacy. We made sure that he learned the fundamentals of math, reading. He was in some budgeting classes. So he took advantage of some of the steps classes, but then he had some typical classes. And then we deviated a lot from his curriculum to test his vocational strength. And so I put him into numerous, like I said, forget history, throw history out the window. Let's test web design, let's test, because I knew some of the areas he was strong in. So the reason why we were able to take him into College of DuPag while he was in steps, he has a combined program. So he would only go to steps. He transitioned to steps. He went like two days a week and three days a week to College of DuPag. And so that's what that transition looked like. And then College of DuPag, we pursued a track of graphic design based on the learnings from high school because I pushed for a very modified curriculum, focused curriculum. Okay. And when did he graduate from the steps transition program? He left early because they had a dedicated building his first year and he had friends and stuff like that. And he still kind of fought it, but he went to COD and he would.. It really like, there were things that were appropriate for him that he could benefit from it. But the stigma was stuck in his head a little bit too much. So he wasn't embracing it completely and he felt it under challenged him. And then when they moved it the second year to high school and split up the steps program and sent people to two couple different high schools and put them in the freshman building. He was objected to that it, and I talked him into trialing it for a little bit, but to no avail. I couldn't get him to go. So he dropped out, I think the age of 20. Okay. What year, around what year and month was that? I think we officially dropped out in March 2017. Okay. And really quick, can you sort of... Oh, can you tell me what type of diploma did he receive? Was it a regular diploma or was it a different kind? Well, he had to get the certificate of completion to go onto steps. And then he got a regular diploma after he exited steps. Okay. So he was awarded that in March of two. Well, they just had it on file, I think. Okay. And so when he exited, he got it. And then his degree is an associates, an applied science graphic design from College of Dupage. And that, he got... Just got, he finished that in May and we started a certificate track building up to that. So that really entailed the graphic design one certificate, a graphic design two certificate, a web development certificate. And then he had to take six general eds. Okay. And just to sort of, now we're done talking about high school. If you can kind of give me an idea, we're trying to get an idea of how he spends his time. And I remember reading, I kind of reviewed my notes from last year. He used to do a lot of things. So I'm curious what you can say. But so what kind of, what does a typical week look like for Michael right now? Well, he's working more because they are giving him more hours. They're just not giving him all full time. So he's working, I'd say about 25 to 30 hours a week. Okay. They're trying to keep him, I think under 30, but this week he has 35. He goes to little friends, one hour on for a social, pragmatic language social group. He sees an LCPC for one hour. And then he does, I'd say an average about four hours, two hours each, between a career coach and his counselor a week, looking for jobs. The balance of it is looking for jobs. And then he does some for fun. He's building up a Fiver account, which would be more of a freelance type of graphic design and trying to keep his skills fresh. And then just hanging out with some friends minimally, unfortunately, but only on like a one thing. Very safe basis. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. I mean, I think that's interesting. It's kind of, yeah. The same for all of us parents, that in that regard, that limited social interaction. It's so difficult to try to safely have our kids see one another or, I mean, they can talk on the phone or whatever, do FaceTime. It's just not the same. No, it's not. And so I'd say that social component really has taken a dive. That's probably been the biggest hit. I mean, he always was pretty popular because he's pretty outgoing, but that has gone down significantly. But luckily, he has a sister that's home now and we're doing a lot more family stuff. Yeah. And that's helpful. Right? And that's good that you guys get along. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, his sister and him are, yeah. Really good for each other. Okay. Just one more time. I know you already told me, but I didn't get it down fast enough. What degree? What's the name of the type of degree he just got? So the initials are AAS. Associate applied science degree in graphic design. Okay. I did get it right. Just want to make sure I got it all. Great. And they kind of want me to ask you questions we've sort of already talked about. What would you say is, were the average amount, average number of classes that he was taking per semester? He took about two per semester. So it took him double the time to finish an associate's degree. Then he was graduating when others were graduating with their bachelors. Okay. And part of that too was stuff, like if he would've gone more days, maybe he would've taken an additional day. But it really depended on how hard the class was. Okay. And we were taking, and then he used summers too. Okay. And I'm trying to go back up to my notes. He started that the same time he started the steps program. So was that... Yes. May or I'm sorry, August 2017. Okay. I'm sorry, 15, 2015. 2015. Great. And then he just finished, which is exciting. Did he receive supports from the program? From the College of DuPag, he used a voice recorder and he used a note taker. And that was a lot with the general eds or the higher level graphic design classes. And... I did coach, or I did private tutor him outside as well, about 10 hours a week through some of those higher level classes and his gen eds because he loved the gen eds. He didn't even take in high school. It was like he was taking them for the first time. And do you think that this, did you feel like this program was a good fit for him? College of Dupage? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I truly don't think that he would've come out of it. He came out of it with like a 3.1, two gram grade point average. I don't think he would've come out of it. He may have had to repeat classes if I didn't put that tutoring, private tutoring on board for the last like two years. But everything else, he did without a tutor. So all the graphic design and all that stuff, he did all by himself. For him. Okay. Yeah. That was his strength, so it was very hands on, lab oriented. Not lecture oriented. Okay. The other ones were ended up being a lot more lecture. And are there any other school programs that he's attended since you and I talked last year? No, but I am considering that with him right now, in terms of how to help him be more competitive with an associate's degree, more marketable. Yeah. Okay. Maybe learning some AutoCAD for interior design, using any type of jobs that could use some programming that he may at some... I mean, I really don't know because I've never tested that, like maybe the mathematics could be too difficult. I'm not sure. Yeah. But I figured a test here, a test there, see how it goes. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I haven't talked to him about that yet, but I'm trying to think forward about, okay. How do you get on par with people who have bachelor's degrees? Okay. So I have a few more questions. We're almost done. I just want to talk about his work at Meyer. Can you tell me a little bit about what does he do there? So he started as a general merchandise clerk and that was pretty much in, let's say, the home goods toy department. And he worked there for, and he still works in there, I'd say a solid, almost three years, just exclusively. But Meyer didn't really develop him in other areas of the store. I think here and there, he might help out in the plant section or something if they needed somebody called in. But that conversation that we had in August, this past year 2020, was what do we need to do to get full-time work here? And it was to learn more areas of the store. So then they moved him into, and the full-time job was in the fashions' department. So, they moved him into that. And now he was telling me too, that they're giving him more exposure to the registers, which I think is also developmentally. So Meyer's has been good with him, but he's had to ask for it. It's not like they said, \"Hey, he's good. Let's move him along.\" He kind of, I think sometimes gets looked over. Okay. Does he, remind me, does he receive supports while he's at Meyer? No. And kind of right now, I'm introducing the fact that he can get that through Josh if he needs it. And his fighting is a little bit, because he's been so used to, he doesn't want. He has friends at Meyer and he is afraid that if the friends start seeing him have helpers, that will impact how they think about him. And I mean, that's something that I told him we need to work on because that doesn't necessarily have to be in his face help. Yeah. There's lots of ways to do it so that it looks... A lot of ways. Yeah. That doesn't have to be necessarily him on the spot. But maybe helping having him a courageous decision or courageous discussion with his manager would be helpful. Even if Josh was beamed in on a phone. Right. Right. So Michael's just thinking about what steps you do and how it had embarrassed him. They used to show up at Walgreen's and talk with him and then go talk to his manager. And he just doesn't want that with Meyer. He could even have him on those like ear pods or some sort of in his ear. There's so many ways you could do it discretely. Yes. It would have to be, just go in the office and get the guy on the phone. Yeah. How, oh, go ahead. No. I mean, but he hasn't thought about that. I haven't talked with him about that yet. That's right where we're at, as of this afternoon. Okay. And how did he find this job at Meyer? Oh, mama. Okay. And no, I'll take that back too, though. He had a friend that was working in the shipping dock and his friend ended up getting fired because somebody kind of went after him and he... But his friend also put in a good word for him, but I went there and sought out a manager tag and was just, I went and he was playing around with the apples when he was playing around with the apples. And I just started up the conversation and said, \"Would you be open to that? Do you need help?\" And he said, \"Yeah. And I definitely think we could use some help.\" And I just kind of gave him a rundown about his three years of retail experience at Walgreen's. But he's down to four hours. I don't know what's going on with the store. It was happening at all the stores. It wasn't just his store. Right, right. But they would use him in the back pocket because he would never call in sick to work. So they would give the hours to the other workers, who weren't even there that long sometimes. And then if they called off, then they would call him. Oh, okay. Okay. And do you remember when he started? Yeah. He started in June 2014. Okay. And I hired a private, like job shadow person just to ensure that if he had any difficulties, that she was there to help him if he had a question. And she just kind of lurked around the store and they agreed to it, and he really didn't need it. So I discontinued it after a couple months. Okay. And do you think that this job is a good fit for his skills and interests? Well, he's comfortable there. People in the autism spectrum have a hard time with change. So, I told him that's a developmental goal that he needs to realize. He's going to need to realize that it's, if you want to take this, your career in the next step and to a different area, you're going to have to let it go. Or maybe work a day or two on the weekend, keep it in your back pocket if you want. But right now with the pandemic, and who knows how long and this recovery will be. And then the work from home, for people who can work from home with computers might be more of a permanent thing. Yeah. It might be. So, I don't see why working at Meyer full-time at this would be a bad thing. Okay. Until he can achieve some, even part-time or freelance or volunteer work, internship, part-time internship without the profits. That's kind of the thought process. Okay. And last question. Is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you haven't shared? No. I just have to say that the Arc of Illinois has been a huge support. I love the fact that the Zoom trainings are available and I'm very disappointed in DRS services. Okay. And that title that I gave you. Yes. I put it in here. I put it in here, because I want to look it up myself later. Okay. And then the last thing that we're just asking so that we're making sure we're updated. Can I have your home address and email just to... Yes. Make sure that I have it correct, still in my. It's home address is 1178 Birchdale Lane, in Aurora, Illinois.\n",
            "finishIs it working? Yes. This is participant 2032, starting with the vocational and it's February 17th. They're fixing the bathroom, so bear with us. It's okay. Has he ever worked during high school? Yes. About how many jobs did he have? He was hired in May at Walgreens one, at Walgreens, between junior and senior year in the summer. Just Walgreens? Yeah. How did he get that job? How did he find it? Through the vocational program at Metea Valley High School and giving a good review. Mom asked the vocational coordinator to help coordinate an interview and he had to. He had to test and meet the criteria that everybody had to meet. Do you remember about how many hours a week he worked? It started slow, six to eight hours. What year, around when did he start? He graduated in 2015, so I'd say 2014, summer of 2014. I put June. I provided. I paid a job shadow to ensure that in the summer, I hired somebody just to make sure it went well. Put that in here, that's down here. Which he ended up not needing because of the vocational program in school. But I just wanted to make sure he didn't get fired right away. That's the job where you had to teach him how to quit was Walgreens? Yeah, actually that location closed down, because they closed some stores and then he had to actually go through a layoff. Then he ended up at another store where a manager already had known him, and then he finished out his three years of Walgreens at that other store. The first store only lasted about six months. Can you tell me just Walgreens in general, around when he stopped working for that company? That was in August of 2017. Even though the school helped bridge him to this job, it wasn't part of school programming, right? No. Working at Walgreens. That's what I thought. I just want to make sure I got it right. To some degree, what they did was they brought him there for about 45 minutes to an hour, to learn how to do check expiration dates, but it wasn't comprehensive of the full job. Can you tell me a little bit about his job title and duties while he was at Walgreens? He was a clerk. What things did he do as a clerk? He stocked shelves. He did what they call facing the shelves. Checking expiration dates and he built up to some customer service asking, answering some questions. If he couldn't, he would seek out, he learned how to seek out help. Then he actually worked the cash register towards the end. Was he still getting job support then? I'm just curious. The only thing that was happening was until he left the STEPS program, the vocational coordinator would check in about once every month to two months with the manager, just to see how things were going. That was it. He was independent. Do you think this was a good fit for Michael at the time? At the time? Yeah. Can you tell me a little bit about why? Well, because I think he learned customer service skills. It gave him confidence in his ability to work. A management versus a subordinate relationship is like, how to plan scheduling for days off or things of that nature. Also, how to quit a job. He also learned valuable lesson about coupon scanning, or scamming, I should say. During high school, did he volunteer anywhere? That was part of the vocational program. He volunteered at Habitat for Humanity and then a pet shelter named Adopt. Now we're going to look at for the rest of this interview about academic of programs and employment, or anything that he's done post high school. Could you tell me a little bit right now, what does a typical week look like for him? How does he spend his time in work, school, whatever, because I know he does both? If he's being asked that question upstairs, he would be complaining right now. Monday and Wednesday, he attends College of DuPag. He is taking two classes to finish up his associates in graphic design. One of the classes actually goes towards the degree, its environmental biology. Then the second class that I signed him up for, which he starts actually Wednesday is a Microsoft Office Suite class. I thought that was important for him to just get some formal training. It's Monday, Wednesdays that ranges from about 8:00 AM. He'll be getting home at about 3:00. Monday nights he's busy. Luckily it's a holiday today. He has drum lessons at 4:30. He has little friends social club at 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. Then he attends a social, its run by a psychologist, social group therapy session co-ed from 7:30 to 8:30. That's Monday. Busy. That's Monday. Tuesday and Thursday mornings, he has tutoring from 8:00 to 11:00 which supports his performance at COD. Also, teaching him plannings life planner skills and things of that nature. Tuesday afternoon and Thursday afternoon, he goes to little friends for a four hour internship for gray, working with underneath the marketing director for graphic design. His Monday, Wednesday school schedule's the same, but his Wednesday afternoons are open. It doesn't mimic how busy he is on Mondays. He's pretty open on Wednesdays after that. Then he does go to a cosplay club at COD on Wednesdays until about 4:00 o'clock. He stays at school and then goes to bed. Fridays, I have him meeting with Parents alliance. It's a newer relationship started in January and it's not going so well. I'm trying to have a vocational rehab person work with him, but the goal of Parents Alliance is to place immediately for a job where he has skill gaps. In other words, you can look for a job all day long, but if you can't interview. From what I understand, that's right where I'm at today. If I weren't here today, I would be making a call to his divisional rehab service coordinator saying \"There's a disconnect here because there's skill gaps.\" You can identify that. I only found that out because I've advocated and called the manager, because the vocational rehab counselor kept canceling on him. Sorry. Instead of just being honest, the state pays when they place. But the state changed their payment policy and used to pay to train. I found that out through questioning, which is why now I understand all the cancellations. How it works. Now I have to problem solve. He goes to that on Fridays and then his job the weekend . Yes, that's first thing in the morning and then he goes to an LCPC for counseling, for anxiety, depression to just complain about whatever. It's at 11:00 o'clock. Then he goes to Meijer at about 3:00 o'clock and he usually works into the evening about 9:00, 10:00 o'clock at night. Saturdays he works about another five to six hours and Sundays about the same. He doesn't have a day off. He works at Meijer. About 15 hours, 16 hours a week, depending somewhere between 15 and 18 hours a week depending on need. He's a busy guy. That's why I said today worked out perfect. Working at Meijer, he's paid for that job, correct? Yes. Total hours, this is hard. They want us to figure out how many hours he spends in all of the vocational and educational activities. If he's in school, you said vocational is 15 to 18? Meijer I'd say on average probably about 16 hours a week. Then he's only doing just started a one hour training with the vocational rehab counselor. I would say it'd probably be around 16 to 17 hours a week. Then adding the classes, how many hours is he there Mondays and Wednesdays? One of them is a 12 week class. One of them is a 16 week. Would it go by Credito? No, just hour, hours. How long are his classes? How long is he at the college? If you can't remember exactly, we can always ask him to. I'd say one class is two and then I'd say maybe four hours. Four hours a week. Monday and Wednesday, so eight hours. Eight hours. Then eight on top of 16. He's busy. Those two pieces and that's not counting all the therapy- And tutoring. ... and the tutoring. And then tutoring, tutoring. Let's add the tutoring. How many hours a week is it tutoring? Six to eight, but depends on how heavy the week, but I'd say on average six. Six, so I'm going to put 30 all together then. Thank you for doing the math with me. We're going to talk first about post secondary programs that he's in, then we'll go into the jobs into Meijer. He is yes, currently enrolled. Some of this you've already told me, I'm just going to type it in. . Four hours of tutoring a week, right? Six. Six, sorry. About six hours. Self funded. Yes. Unfortunately. Because I didn't have something to write it down, can you remind me, what are the two classes you told me about that he's taking right now? Environmental biology is the last one that he needs to actually physically get the associates. Thank you. The other one I added was a 12 week program for Microsoft Office that goes over Excel, word, PowerPoint and Access. Thank you. He has some of those skills, but I just want to make sure he's secure. That's great, because they're so needed. On average, how many classes did he usually take per semester? I know he's taking two right now. He took it very slow, he's almost 23. He should have had his bachelor's degree, so it took him double the time. He on average took two classes a semester and then he would take usually two in the summer, one to two in the summer, depending on the difficulty. Would you consider him a full time or part time student? He's always been part time- Part time. ... based on the and credit hour rating. Do you remember roughly the month and year that he started at COD? Yeah, August of 2015. Thank you. Supports, did he get any accommodations during the program, or any kinds of support? Yeah, actually he got a blue card, so he did show his IEP. But very little usage of them until he hit the general education classes, because a lot of the graphic design program was very visually driven. I would say as of late he's learned not to hide and the benefit of it, but he really didn't want to disclose that. Do you remember when he was getting supports, what kinds? He uses one of those voice recorders. He would have a note taker. He would have extended time on tests, audiobooks. That's pretty much it. Thank you. Any additional comments that you have about the program that we haven't talked about that you want me to put in here? About his overall programming in general? Yeah, the COD program. Not his whole week, just the COD. Just COD? Yes, please. I think they did the best they could based on the fact that spectrum people are all over the spectrum. Yes. I think that the major flaw is that when you're dealing with say with graphic design, you're not hiring people who actually are teachers. When you used the term FERPA, they had no clue. They didn't really know how to deal with special needs people. I really would like to see COD train people who are not certified teachers, at least on both that show a blue card and what that really means. That's good to know. Thank you for sharing that. I didn't know that. They hire business people who have a master's degree in certain areas, graphic design was one of them. Is there another school or program that he's attended post high school, that we haven't talked about? He went to district 204 Naperville, district 204 STEPS program part time from 2015, that would've been August. Now to go back and answer your question because of my memory. From about August of 2015, he would've been considered a full time student between both programs, but it wasn't in the same building per se. He went to about 12 hours a week at the STEPS program. August 2015 and he exited the program in 2017, it was March or April. He only went for two years, because it was not benefiting him and it was just taking time away from him. Could you say those dates one more time? August of 2015. Until about March of 2017. He only utilized it for two years, or little less than two years. He did not go to ESY summer schools. He didn't qualify for that. Would you say the STEPS program was ... its non-degree seeking certification? It's more life and slash vocational transitional training. And then it also deals with social emotional. Since they have social workers and speech paths and OTs and everybody involved, but it is with the intent of being independent and hopefully getting a job. Vocational. Unfortunately, Michael he never fit into the box. He was somewhere in between a typical peer and a STEPS peer. He's in that spot. He's in the middle of everything, which makes it super hard. Probably hard to find friends too. Actually he is the most social person as you saw him. Yes, I did. He is very friendly. He is the most popular person, when you put him amongst peers of his like. When you put him in his typical peer situation, he tends to be more reserved, until he starts finding some commonalities. That's due to a lot of social training throughout in addition social training. To all the other things. I think part of his core personality. Thank you. When he was at STEPS, did they have actual classes? I know it's a little bit different there. Yeah, they did. But how many a week would you say? He would go two days a week. I think it was Tuesday, Thursdays were his day and he would go from 8:00 AM until about 2:00. Probably 2:00 to 3:00? Yeah. He chose to leave the program and you said it just wasn't giving him what he needed, right? He was school refusal mode by the time year two hit. They also in 204 closed down the building that they were all in together and then distributed them, broke up the group into the three high schools in 204. That further created school refusal, because they were putting them in the freshman building at Nico Valley. Here we have a 21 year old with beard with freshmen in high school. He said \"I don't want to be in that environment.\" Good for him for knowing that. Also, I thought as a parent, it put him in jeopardy because if he said something inappropriate to a minor, that could have been a problem legally. Did he receive supports when he was in this program? He got social work, he got OT and speech. The social work and speech were collaboratively, and then they would go out into the community and do things in the community. Like I said, the vocational coordinator would check in periodically at Walgreens. Other than that, it was still just being connected with peers that he knew. Thank you. Christina will be asking him about his opinions about these places too, so that'll be interesting. Oh gosh. Any other schools that he attended, or was that it? What was it called? I wouldn't call it a school. I had him join the PARCC, P-A-R-C-C which is offered in DuPag County for Microsoft training, Excel training. That was free of charge. He did go to an evening class with a bunch of people my age, who had no clue about Microsoft. He was so frustrated, but I thought I would try to turn over that stone before I registered him for a class this past semester. Other than that, no. How long was he there? Just eight weeks and I never signed him up again because he's like, please don't put me with a class of old people again. Its Microsoft. Microsoft Excel in particular, because I knew he hadn't had any exposure to that. Can you remember average number of classes that he took in this program? That was just that one. It was one night a week on Mondays or Wednesdays or something like that. Can you remind me the date? When did he start? That was probably in the fall. It was in the summer. I would just say May to end of July. What's the year? It was this past. It just happened? 2019. 2019. It was an eight week session. You would say he completed it though, even though did he didn't want to do it again? He did. The other thing I did with him was a free and this was maybe two years back career explanation, training through NAMI in DuPag, which went over the idea. They had a booklet and they had an instructor teaching about resumes and cover letters and what people look for. It was more speaking to the components that you need to find a job. Their goal was for mental health people with a mental health, which he has a comorbidity along with his autism. Autism it's secondary. I found that and that was free of charge and it was during the summer. It was maybe about an eight week session, one night a week. It was resume building and- Just understanding vocation, how to find a job, what your strengths, your weaknesses, what employers value, things like that. These are all things I've found on my own. ... Yes. I can tell, they're very specific and good helpful. Going back real quick to the first one. When we were just talking about the Microsoft Excel, did he get supports when he was in that program? No. Were they not available, or he didn't want to use them, or you didn't even think about it? I verbally just prepped the instructor and he breezed through it so well because of his computer. He didn't really need them. He just never really walked through what Excel's capabilities were. He did benefit from it, it's just that he cruised through it. Because there were some people who didn't know how to use Control, Alt, Delete or something like that. Him and all the oldies. Some that just knows computer skills whatsoever. Let's look at his employment. He's currently at Meijer. Do you remember how to spell that? M-E-I-J-E-R. Thank you. That's his most recent job. Can you tell me a little bit about what he does there? Yes. He is a general merchandise clerk. Pretty much he works in the area of toys, electronics. I think that also encompasses the pet and the automotive section. It's a certain area within the back area. Then they rotate people in and out of greeting for half an hour. He's done that a little bit of that sometimes when they needed help in the garden center, he's done that. He works the register in the electronics department. He knows how to do that, but I don't think he primarily works that. They keep him a little bit more on the floor. He's on the floor answering questions. What else does he do on the floor? Cleaning up, straightening up, taking care of the fish tank, feeding them, catching fish when people want one. There's some fun stories. Pretty much anything. If they have to reorganize the store or some special projects. Getting down bikes, definitely answering questions. If he doesn't know the answer, he has to seek out help. He seeks a manager or a co-worker. He's okay with that? Yeah, that's where I'd say Walgreens did a really good job prepping him. Helping him fit. He's paid for this job? Yes. Working. Does he receive supports? No. But as for career advancement there, he has been stagnant probably because he could use supports to be taught to go to the next level. If he ever wanted to go to be a cashier, not that he couldn't do it because he did it at Walgreens. But he can't identify all the vegetables, or he can't identify and there's a lot of codes and stuff. Where would the next level be? I don't see that happening without supports. Without supports. That's something that could be needed. Working with pay independently. Remind me, how did he find this job? I shopped at Meijer. There you go. Happened to go next to a person with a colored shirt who was a manager and just opened up a discussion, and told him about his three years experience at Walgreens. And what Walgreens did to him in terms of cutting his hours down from about eight to 10 a week, to four a week. That didn't really even fill up his gas tank and how that was not fair. That the only reason why was because he never called in sick and he was valuable. The younger generation tends to call off all the time. They were misusing him and that he would be a good employee and is there an opening? He did. He said yeah? Yeah, he said \"Bring him in.\" Then he did have a friend that happened to work there who also has special needs and put in a good word for him, and they hired him within a week. Do you remember when that was? Yeah, that was August of 2017. 2017. He went from job to job. That's fantastic. He's still there? Yes. He's got two jobs basically on his resume that show longevity. Just trying to see. Did he participate in any other employment, vocational, or volunteering activities after high school? Nothing more than ...\n",
            "finishOkay. This is participant 2031, February 17, 2020. I'm going to start with the vocational and activity index. Okay. So Grace is still in high school, correct? Yes. She's 17. Has she worked at all during high school? No. Okay. Has she ever volunteered while she was in- Yes. ... through high school. Okay. And where has she volunteered or did she volunteer? She volunteered, not regularly, but she is in the gospel choir, and they have gone to Feed My Starving Children a couple times and I know somewhere else. I'm not thinking of it right now. Yeah, she's done a couple of things like that. I know a couple of them. Oh, they volunteered at a nursing home. All with the choir? Yeah. I feel like there's been other places, but I can't think of it right now, but those are the two that are most recent that are sticking out in my mind. We were involved with a group called Haley's Playground in the West Suburbs that brought ... It's all families who have children with disabilities. And we did some volunteering back then. That was many years ago. I just can't remember where. We went with that group a couple of times too. But yeah, I can't remember. What's the name of the group one more time? It was called Haley's Playground, but they don't exist anymore. Okay. Great. That was easy. That one's done. Thank you. Let me ... great. Sorry. She was in Girl Scouts, and they did that. We'll put that in there. That's great. Yeah, they volunteered. I can't remember where. It's okay. So the next round of questions that I'm going to ask-\n",
            "finishGavin's vocational history. Please give me one second. You've answered most of these I just have to fill in the boxes here. Okay. So we're just going to talk about what he's doing now. And can you remind me about Gavin's high school situation? Is he still in high school or receiving services through the school system at all? That means even if he graduated and is in the transition service? No, right? Correct. Okay. When did Gavin graduate? It was... Cause he's... May of 2000. Hey Gavin... 2017. Okay. And then he did not go into a transition program at the high school afterwards? Or did he? He did not, no.  Okay.  It was not even offered. Mm-hmm . What happened? Did he go straight to the College of DuPag? Yes, he did. Mm-hmm , thank you. We're kind of just starting at baseline high school questions for everyone. So 2017... May, where's May, there it is. Did he graduate with a regular diploma or like a certificate of completion? No regular diploma. Okay. So then for the rest of the interview, I'm just going to ask you about some sort of all the academic programs and the employment and any volunteering that he's done since we saw each other last year. Okay. So you kind of mentioned this already to get an idea of how he usually spends his time during a typical week. Can you kind of just run down for me, what does a typical week look like for Gavin? I realize he's not out of the house much, but anything you can provide. Yeah. So a typical week, he does do some stuff around the house. So walking the dog in the morning, he'll do that, maybe three times a week. He usually gets up when he gets up and he may run a couple errands, pick up his meds, pick up some stuff at the store or get some fast food. And then he does hang out with friends. Usually it's one person at a time. And now he does have some friends that are... they go away to college, but because of COVID, they're home longer now. So he has been doing that a little bit more. And then the rest of the time is usually either on his computer where he does modding or he's gaming, sometimes with friends. And that's kind of, for the most part, that's what it looks like. Okay. And you said he's going to begin one class at a time at College of DuPag. When is he starting that up again? Yeah, he starts that, I think it's mid-February, I think. Okay, great. And does he do any volunteering? No. Okay. So now we're going to talk sort of specifically about school programs that he's attended. So he lives at the College of DuPag, So he lives at home. So when COVID hit... So when we spoke last, was he in school still? He was correct? And he finished that? Yep, he was, yes. Okay. Thank you. Starts in mid-February. And then can you give me just a couple more details about what happened with his job at the College of DuPag? Okay. So with the job that he had at COD it was tied to being a student. Okay. So obviously once they went remote, he was getting unemployment. They told him that he probably would have to reapply once everything kind of settles down. So its similar to kind of DRS. They have their own rules too. You have to have a certain GPA, you have to be taking x number of classes in order to keep that job. Okay. And so he couldn't meet the requirements then during COVID? Yeah,  the campus shut down. Yep. Just like everywhere right? Yes. Okay, great. And that is about it for us. Is there anything else you want to share or any updates that we didn't talk about? I only had one question. Yeah, of course. And I...\n",
            "finishOkay, this is participant 2027. It's February 12th, 2020. All right. So we'll start with vocational. Is Logan still in high school? He's in the transition program. So. We're counting that as yes. Okay. Yeah, there was a lot of debate,  but I now decided that we want to count that as yes. And while in high school, has he ever worked? Yes. Okay. And about how many jobs has he had? Are you including jobs through his high school work training? Yes. Then he has had, let me think for a moment. I'm going to say he's had about eight jobs. Okay, great. And did he get paid for any of the jobs? Yes. All right. Great. So he's had a lot of jobs. Can we talk about either the job he's had, but which one is he have the longest? Is there one where he is kind of made his mark? His longest job was at Oberweis. Okay. The dairy ice cream place. Mm-hmm  Does he still work there? No. Okay. How did he find that job? He visited the place with his steps, transition people, and they had mentioned that Logan would be a good fit. And so they were happy to have him on board. The business  thought he would end up at Oberweis? Right. Okay. Great. . And how many hours a week on average did he work at this job? He worked about 10 hours a week. Great. And do you remember when he began month and year? Roughly? Let's see it wasn't this summer. So it was the last two summers. So 2017 through 2018, just the summers. So he would start like in June. And then he would go into the school year, so to the end of September. Okay. Okay. So we'll say then the end of September of this year? Of the previous year, because he didn't work there this last summer. Okay. So then... He wanted to try something different. So that would be 2018 as well. Right? He started in- Yeah, 2017 and then 2018. Okay. I should have brought his little resume with me. Oh yeah. We didn't warn you to do that. We're asking you to bring so many things. Let me just fix that 18, 17. Okay. And that was in the community. So the school helped him find the job, but was it part of school programming working at Oberweis? No, it was not. And can you tell me a little bit about what he did at the job? Yeah, he was the... I forget how you phrased it... the front person. So he would clean the tables. He would interact with the customers when they came in, he would do some dishes work in the back. He filled stock in the refrigerators. And I'm trying to think if there's... oh, and the garbage and anything related to keeping all the tables and customer requests up front. Okay. . And did he receive support while he was working there? No. Oberweis would not allow anyone to come in, because he could have had work support, but they said no. But the manager, she's like, \"We can work with Logan\", and they did. They taught him a bunch of stuff and it worked out really great. Why didn't they want anyone? I don't know. But it would've been awesome if they did. That's really interesting. Yeah. It was like a corporate thing. Okay. So, but they did not want to, but they worked with him. They worked with him. Right. He must have been successful, because he was asked back for a second summer. Oh they loved him. They all loved him. Yeah. Great. Okay. Do you think it was a good fit for his skills and interests? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about why? He is definitely a social person. The job he had this last summer was in a warehouse and he was by himself and it was just a horrible experience for him. He hated it. They also were really smart about motivating him. They have music, their version of a jukebox. So he was allowed to pick music because he was out there on the floor and he loves music. So that was just a really great fit for him. And he gets along with adults really well. And they just really responded to him, and he felt really comfortable working there. And I think some customer had given him, I forget what they call it, a good employee thing. You know like, \"hey, this guy's really doing a great job\". So he got recognized for that. This isn't on this questionnaire, but I'm just curious when he's done with his transition program, which is probably within this year sometime. Is he thinking about going back or... He would always just do summer. He's going to COD. So he's doing steps, and he's doing COD, two classes. So when he finishes, he'll probably just take four classes, filling his week. Go to school. Yeah. His issue is, he really needs a lot of support. So every day he sees a tutor and then that takes up all the time he would have for a part-time job. So I know, it kind of stinks, but... But that's exciting that he is going to full-time school when he is done. I mean four classes. That's a lot. That's full time. Yeah. And this semester, because he's taking two now. This semester is his first semester with, I'm going to call them legit college classes because he's been on all the placement classes. So he's kind of excited about that. And has he started? He has, he has. Okay. And so how's it going? So far, so good. Its math. Math is just a killer. So he does well with the tutor, but testing, when he does his tests, he's always low there. So. Okay. I was just thinking, and he goes to the COD... I'm just curious, how open are they with accepting supports and giving of accommodations? All the placement classes would not allow a calculator, which was brutal. This is his first class that has a calculator. But they're pretty good. They allow you to request a note taker for things. And there's one college advisor there, his name's Dr. Michael Duggan and he's created Autismerica. I'm not sure if you're familiar with that at all? So every month they meet. So all the students with autism meet and then they kind of socialize and he's kind of like, just watches out for them, and tells you what classes have the good teachers or maybe a teacher that has a son or daughter with autism. So they're a little more understanding. So yeah, that's been very helpful. That's really great. That would be a reason to have your child go to the College of DuPag. Just knowing that service is there. Yes. And they also just started for, I think Plainfield, or maybe it's not Plainfield. It's only one school district, so it's not ours, but this one school district transitions students that are going to COD, have their own special space now. So it's like some pilot program. So I'm glad to see that they are trying to do something. Absolutely. Thanks for sharing that. I had no idea. Like I said, it's not on here, but I'm just curious how it works. Because it's funny here we put that he's still in high school, but he's really, he is transitioning. That's a whole point of this program too. While he was in high school, did he volunteer at all in the community? We did, at the Loaves and Fishes, which is a grocery store for people that can't afford to buy groceries. So we spent a summer doing that, and he enjoyed that. That was taking care of two sections of produce and then letting them know how much they can take and things like that. So he liked that. Okay, great. That's it for this one. That was awesome. Thank you. Let's just see. Okay. One second. All right. So we're going to move on to the service access.\n",
            "finishNow we're going to look at Gavin's vocational history. Mm-hmm . I just need to set this up here. Is he still in high school? He's in college. I know that some people are still in transition programs and also taking a few classes, so I wasn't... True, true. But he's not doing that, he's full-time at College of DuPag? Correct. When he was in high school, did he work? Briefly. And about how many jobs do you think he had? Well, do you count one if it was for two weeks? Sure. Then I would say two. I had one like that when I was in high school, it was just too much. It certainly was. Art Institute, I remember it was. Oh, no, I think that would be a great one. Yeah, right. It was in the shop, it was too far. Yeah it didn't work. Anyway, enough about me. Did he receive payment for any of those jobs? Yes. He did. Yes. Could you just tell me the name of the job that he held, for longer than two weeks, of the two? Jewel. And how did he find that job? It was actually through the high school, for vocational services. Great. And about how many hours a week did he work? It varied from 12 to 16. Do you remember when he began working? He started summer of... Let's see, 2020, maybe 2017? And does he currently work there? No. Do you remember about when he stopped? After six months. So June, July, August, around November-ish? It was actually right around Christmas. So we'll put December 2017? Correct. And so, you said the school got him the job. So was this considered part of school programming? No, I would say it was outside of that. Outside of that, okay, great. And then, can you tell me a little bit about his job duties, his job title at Jewel? He was a bagger/cart person. Retriever, I would say? Yeah. So he bagged groceries? And pushed carts. Did he bring carts back from the parking lot back into the store? Yes. Okay, so store and parking lot. Did he receive support, like job coaching or any kind of support when he was working at the Jewel? Minimal. Can you tell me what kinds of support he had? Basically, just when he was told how to do the job. By somebody at Jewel? Right, yes. So he was trained, but he didn't have a job coach or someone coming in? Actually, there may have been somebody, but he doesn't really talk about that. It was probably the person that got him the job from the high school. So she was kind of that liaison. Thank you. Do you think this was a good fit? No. For his skills? No. Can you tell me why not? Okay, let's see. He definitely hated the carts, because it was heavy. He was working under weather, and so he didn't like sweating, he didn't like getting cold. He didn't like being on his feet, jamming his fingers on the carts. He didn't like his boss because he's very sensitive to tone, so he was not really good socially in reading. And she actually did try. I mean, I did speak with her on a number of occasions and she was trying to understand him. She was trying to work with him. He didn't see it that way. And it interfered with his gaming. So since the schedule changed, he's a guy that's kind of rigid and he likes things to be done at a certain time. And so, since that job, the hours, change almost every week, he did not like that, as well. That must have been hard for him, out of his comfort zone. It was, it was. Did Gavin volunteer at all in the community during high school? A couple of times, when we would do some volunteer activities through our church. Can you just give me the name of a couple of those? Once a year, our church, they put together a help out the neighborhood kind of a day. And so, there was one day when we came and we cleaned buildings, we painted walls, that sort of thing. Great. For the rest of this interview, I'm going to ask you about academic programs, employment, volunteering after high school. First, what we're going to do, is I would just like if you could give me an overview of how he usually spends his time? What does a typical week look like for him? During the school year, he's not full-time because he can't handle that, so he takes roughly about eight to 10 hours of classes. He does work at COD for about 12 to 16 hours, which he really, really enjoys. It's an office job. I'm actually surprised that he likes it. They have him do just like your office related type jobs, taking out staplers, putting in books, stamping things. He seems to be fine with that. And then, the rest of the time when he comes home, he spends a lot of that time on the computer. And so on the computer, he's either modding, he's gaming, he's cleaning files, he's tweaking things on his system. I would say that's a majority of what he does. So he's very savvy with the computer. He is, he is. Okay, great. My computer froze for a moment. So currently then, I would say, he's in school, working for pay? Mm-hmm . Great. How many total hours a week do you think, I can do the math, that he's spent participating in all of this? So you said about eight to 10 hours for class, 12 to 16 for office jobs. So 25 hours roughly, 26? Probably about 26 or so, that sounds about right. Now, we're going to go piece by piece, starting with school programs. Currently he is enrolled at the College of Dupage. And is there a certain program that he's in? It has kind of changed. It started with something more technical based, because we really thought that that was where he was going to go. He was having problems with some of his teachers. And then, I think maybe his learning style, how he learns, he's best when he investigates on his own as opposed to being given the information. Okay. So, what is it, November? We changed his major for the third time. Okay. And so at this point, we just want to see him graduate with an associate's. So right now, he's shooting for Associate's of Arts. He started with technical. We're trying to keep it as generic as possible. It gives you more options, actually. Well, I hope so. So that would be liberal arts? Yeah. Okay, great. Post secondary, some of these, I can answer on my own. You just answered that. So liberal arts is the general program, is there a certain area of study that he's focusing in on or are you keeping it broad? We're trying to keep it broad. And then, about how many classes does he take per semester? He is currently taking three classes. And you said that's not full-time. Could we call that part-time or maybe three fourths time? I would call it actually just very part-time. Because one class he's taking, it's career development so it's a very small class. So it's very part-time.  Right now, he's taking eight hours. Eight hours? Okay, great. Do you remember when he started at College of Dupage? He started in, let's see, '17, '18... Maybe I'm getting my years messed up. It had to be the fall of 2018. 2018, okay. And is he receiving supports in the program? He is signed up for accommodations, so getting longer test time. He can get notes but he's, I think, too embarrassed. There's a pride factor there. Anything else? If there was, I would be on the bandwagon. That's as far as I know what we can do for accommodations. All right. Any other comments that you might have about this program, or anything you want to tell me about his experience at College of DuPag? It's been a mixed bag. We had a lot of high hopes starting in the program. And right now, it's like, \"Okay, let's see if you can just even graduate.\" Okay. I don't know if this would be of any significance, but he's always struggled when it comes to studying. And this is something that I've known about him for the longest time. He's a smart kid, but to the point where he's like, \"I don't need to study.\" And then in high school, it's like, \"At some point, it's going to catch up with you.\" It has totally caught up with him. And so, that's part of the reason why we are having issues, because he does not want to put in the time to study for tests. Gotcha. Great, thank you for sharing that. We'll be asking him about it, too. We won't share what you just said, but we'll be asking him his feelings about it  and if it's a good fit. So it'll be interesting to see what he says. Are there any other school programs that he's attended post high school? No. Okay. There was one, actually. It was through COD, but it was completely independent. It was a camp for cybersecurity, a week long camp. And he did enjoy it. But it was very informal, it wasn't like you were graded for tests. But I think he got a lot out of that camp. It was a relatively short program, but he did attend that. Okay, so a week long. And can you tell me a little about what did he do? He was learning to... He might be able to tell you more than me. And I'm wondering if it was longer than a week. But it was a program that, I think, they were trying to find ways to recruit kids to get into the program, because there is such a need for cybersecurity analysts. And so, he got what they call a Raspberry Pi, it's a mechanical computer device, which he loves that. And so, he got some cool stuff, he got to do some cool stuff. But honestly, I don't remember, because it's been a while back. No problem. Did he get a certificate at the end? He got something. I want to say he did get some sort of a certificate. He could probably tell us some of the details, too. Oh, yeah. More than you probably want to know. So it was a week or maybe more, full-time when he went, because it was a camp? It was. I don't remember too many of the details, but I remember it was something that we took a chance. Not sure if he was going to like it, because he's pretty rigid about that sort of thing. But I was surprised that he did enjoy it. Okay, great. And can you remember when he started? Oh, boy. That would be either the summer of '17 or the summer of '18. June, July, what do you think? July, I'm going to guess. We'll do July. Should I put '17 or '18? Just pick one, it's okay if you don't remember exactly. '17. Great. And then, he left because the program ended? Mm-hmm . Okay. So he completed it, which I was happy about. And liked it. And liked it, that was a bonus. And did he receive supports when he was in this program? He did not. Did he not use them or were they not available? I don't think it was available. Any other comments about this program? That's it. That's it? Okay, great. Any other school programs? I don't think so. Great. So now, we're going to move into vocational. Is he currently in a vocational? Does he have a job? Part-time job, yes. The College of DuPag? Mm-hmm . Can you give me his job title? And can you describe for me again what kind of duties he has? Administrative assistant. And on average, he does... 12 to 16 a week. And you mentioned he files... He files, he does a lot of filing, stamping books, putting books away for the semester, I think getting them ready for the semester. I think that's generally about it Okay. And does he receive supports? He does not. Okay. And is he paid? I think you said he was, right? Yes. And how did he find this job? Through the employment at school. I'm going to ask you, of course, do you remember when he began? Yeah, that one is easy. That one was January 2019. About a year ago, huh? Mm-hmm . Any other comments about this job? He's surprised how much he likes it. Because after the job at Jewel, he didn't think he would ever love a job again. Totally different environment, right? Completely different environment. Completely different about everything. Great. Let's see what he has to say about that one, too. Any other jobs since leaving high school? No. It's nice that he can work where he goes to school, kind of keep it all in one place. They make it flexible for him. So he can do either a big block of time or if something has to change, he can go in between classes. It's right there. It's during the weekday, he never has to work on the weekends. And the other big benefit, which I keep telling him, I said, \"You're not going to get this anywhere else,\" is that if he has nothing to do, he can game or be on his phone. So it's ideal for him. Right. I mean, I'm just thinking about what you're saying. It's opposite in every way from the Jewel. It is. The flexible hours and him being able to make his own schedule for the most part, versus the changing. Oh, yeah. They've been very accommodative. He says he feels like he can be himself around them, and so it sounds like he's got a rapport with them. I'm surprised he likes it as much as he does. Once in a while he gets bored, but I'm like, \"You know, all of us, I think, get bored from time to time.\" And he says, \"Yeah, I kind of figure that that's probably normal.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, it is.\" Oh, that's great. Hopefully he can keep it up. Keep it up. Well, he has to keep a certain level GPA and he has to have a certain number of classes that he's taking every semester, in order for him to stay on board. So it's like a work-study program, sort of? He hasn't described it that way, but I'm not sure if he knows the terminology. I don't know if I know the terminology, that was just... I know when I was going to school, yes, we did have that. That's what we would call it, I think, yeah. That's what we would call it. All right. Well, great, very helpful. So we will move on. Sorry, let me just... What is that? Is that a ring tone? It's a bad ring tone. That was a terrible ring tone. It's funny. What was it? I love the beach, it's supposed to be the waves. But if it's a lower setting, it sounds more like a wave. But when it's really high, it just sounds like the white noise. It sounds like white noise. Like the white noise machine. It also reminded me of when you hear people out at a basketball game, and everyone's like, \"Ah,\" all at once. I don't know, it sounded like a big group yell or something. I didn't know what it was. Oh, that was funny. All right. So we're going to look at... Oh, I'm in the wrong thing. We're going to look at the goals that you picked for Gavin and talk about those. Just one second. Here they are.\n",
            "finishI could ask him. He might remember, but to be honest, I don't remember. I'll just put party rental. Yeah. It was - Company. Like a little mom and pop operation. Okay. And how did he find this job? His transition coordinator at school recommended it. She has community contacts and she's always advocating for her kids. Was it part of school programming, or she just found it for him? Yeah. She just found it and just connected us together. Great. She sounds great, that's great. Yeah. And then, you said he worked long hours, so about how many hours a week do you think, on average? So, it was only weekends. So, if he worked on Friday and Saturday, he could work between 8 to 12 hours on either of those days. So anywhere between 16 to 24. Yeah. If it was two days? Exactly. Okay. Right. And what month and year he start? So 2019, right, or?  It was 2019. Okay. I want to say that he started in August, right when school maybe went back? Okay. But I could be slightly off. That's okay. Yeah. And then it was seasonal, so it was until like maybe late October. Okay, that's perfect. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. And then you answered that. Okay. And you said, can you tell me one more time? Just because I have to type it again. Sure, sure. What was his job title and his duties? So again, the actual title, I'm not sure, but his duties were, he would assist with transportation, set up, tear down of party rental supplies. So, like chairs, tables, jump houses, that kind of thing. One time, he had to dress up as Woody from Toy Story. So, there was some character stuff too. Okay. So, he had to dress up as Woody and like interact with kids, and all of that? Yeah. Which I was like, oh boy, how did that go? How did it go? Do you know? He said it was okay, because Woody couldn't talk. So, you know, it was really just... Got it. Yeah. But yeah, whoever was supposed to be Woody flipped out at the last minute, so he got shoved in a costume. Okay. I don't have any pictures, but he said it went okay. Rises up to the challenges. Apparently, yeah. Okay. So I have assisting with transportation, party set up and tear down, chairs, tables, bouncy houses, dress up as characters. Anything else? I think, to my understanding that about sums it up. Okay. Now, did he receive any support while he was working? Job coaching? I don't know that he did. Okay. Again, it was mom and pop, and it was someone who understood that he had... So I know he got directions. Okay. You know, explicit directions, but beyond that, I'm not sure that he did. Okay. So there was no... okay, yeah. Job training, transportation, job coach. Okay so, I'm going to put no because it sounds like he didn't get any formal Supports. Yeah I do not think that's what happened at all. And do you think it was a good fit for him, this job? I think it was a good first job fit for him. Can you tell me a little bit why? I think first of all, he had a compassionate employer. Someone who understood that he had special needs and was willing to take him on. So that's I think the biggest barrier. Yes. Second of all, I think that he was working in a fairly unstructured setting, where there wasn't a lot of rules for him to break or violate. It was pretty much, go set this up, go take that down. Yes. So it was less complicated than something more structured, where he might skip a step or forget something or get overwhelmed.  Okay. I also think it was good that he was working from what I could tell, with similarly-aged peers, so it may have been a good social time for him. Okay. Yeah. Okay, that's great. Thank you. Okay, and during high school, you said he did volunteer right? With your husband - With my husband doing some church stuff like passing out meals for the holiday, or very informal. Okay. Passing out meals... Great. Anything else that I'm missing? that was it the one job so far, right? Yeah. That's that. Fantastic. Christina? Yes. Sorry to interrupt on you. I'm here. Jared is still in high school. So, I'm guessing you probably won't have - Okay. You won't have any green sections to ask him. Yeah. Okay, but I'll just double-check, just to make sure. Yeah, okay. Thanks. If to use this out of high school, then we have questions on here that we have to ask them as well to see their opinions. Okay, great. This is going so well.\n",
            "finishSo this one is going to look at some of the activities he's been involved in. And we are starting this particular part of the interview, we want to talk about his high school experience. It's kind of like our baseline. And I know that he wasn't in high school when we talked last year, but I'm just going to ask if you could describe sort of how did his high school situation play out? Did he do the transition service? When did he graduate? Things like that. Okay. Well, so he graduated in '16. So, May of '16. He was always... I don't know what's the right word. He always got services in high school, supported special tests, customized tests, that kind of stuff. But he was in,I guess I'll call it mainstream for lack of a better word. I'm sure I committed some political violation there. It's okay. He was not in the room that you never left. He was over with the people that went to social studies class. And he tried to figure out social studies. Did he get it? I don't know. Did they customize his tests? Yes. Okay. So whatever, whatever you call that was his experience on the academic side. On the social transition side, he didn't get... He never went into the STEPS transition program in NICWA. If you recall, we went straight from NICWA to the Iowa program. Oh, right. So Iowa, technically, while it's on a college campus is a transition program. Now not funded and supported by Illinois because it's super expensive, but it is a transition program. Okay. I don't know if that helps you or not. We effectively got a degree out of high school because he graduated. Yeah. So what type of diploma did he receive? Was it a regular one or certificate? No, he got a regular diploma.I don't know if that was a good move or not. We could debate that someday when you're not doing a survey, but yes, he got a regular diploma. It actually hurts us now when you go to voc rehab, because they start with an impression that he's way more functioning than he probably is. I love him dearly, but he's a laborer. He's a move boxes, load shelves, sweep floors, pack the truck kind of guy. And when you say he has a high school degree and he went through a two year program in college, they think he's going to program a computer. Anyway, I digress. I'm probably driving you crazy, but we're trying to get better in explaining what he did in terms of, don't call it a degree just talk about what he did versus what he got. Exactly. If that makes sense. Yeah, exactly. So yeah, he got a regular degree, then the Iowa program, which was in effect his transition program was he got a certificate. Okay. Because you don't get a degree from there. Yep. Okay. Yeah, I remember talking about that with you now because it's similar to a program where I worked when I first started out at PACE program, kind of like on a college campus. Yeah. Okay, great. And now kind of for the last part of this interview, we're just going to ask about any academic programs, employment, or volunteering that he's done since we talked last year, so first I'd just like to get an idea of how Liam usually spends his time in those three areas. Can you tell me a little bit about the activities he participates in right now during a typical week? Like right now? Yeah.  in the middle of... It's a lot of iPhone time. Yeah. So here's what we do. We have him twice a week. He goes to, we've signed him up for a workout, private trainer go lift weights and stuff. Try to keep some weight off. We have internalized in the house he has his jobs, so one or two a day, every day. They don't take a ton of time but clean the windows, clean the floors, vacuum, toilets, that kind of stuff. We are going to start this program, the day program, next week. So, that'll be one day a week. They are actually starting practice for Special Olympics down here, because they're a little more open than up north. So he's going to start that. If I could find him a job a couple hours a week, I would. Okay. Otherwise there's a lot of staring at TVs and iPhone screens and trying to stay busy. Yeah, okay. And, all right, so and when he does that program next week, how many hours did you say is it during the week? All day. Well, he's only going to go Thursdays from 9:00 to 4:00, I think. 9:00 to 3:00. Okay. So six to seven hours. I'm sorry? So wait 9:00 to 3:00, you said? Okay, so six... Yeah, so about six to seven hours. Yeah. Their actual programming is dated as 9:00 to 3:00. You can drop off as early as 8:00. You can pick up as late as 4:00. That's just to accommodate people's schedules. Okay. That's good. All right. And then in terms of... I mean we've kind of talked about this, all right. School programs, is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in any academic program since we talked last year? No. Okay. I didn't think so. And then, so now I'm going to ask you just a few more questions and then we'll be done about the job that he lost. During that job, I have my notes from last year, was he was working about eight hours a week, he was paid correct? Eight hours a week. Yes. That's about right. And yes, he was paid. Yep. Great. And I'm just going to have to ask you some of the same questions from last year, sorry. But can you just tell me a little bit about what he did at that job? Call it warehouse help for lack of a better word. So, loaded trucks, unloaded trucks, swept the floor, packed boxes, restock shelves. I'm sure there was an element of garbage and that kind of stuff, but you know. Does that help you? . Yeah, that's exactly what I'm looking for. Yeah. And did he receive supports while participating? Job coaching? Anything like that? Any supports? Well, early on, so the first he was on a... Why am I drawing a blank? What did they call the program? Voc rehab when they pay you... Milestone, he was on a milestone contract. So he got some support for the first 60 or 70 days. Where they came and helped them. But then once you're deemed to have met your milestones that disappears. Okay. Let's see. All right. Good to know. The support, it ends all together? The support? Oh yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You're on your own. Okay. And how did he find this job? We were working with, up there it was Aspire. So, Aspire effectively has a job placement program, day program. They helped us find it. And can you remember on average, how many hours a week he worked? You said eight, right?  No, it ended up being about eight by the time we were done. At one when he might have been up in the 12 range, but not much more than that. Okay. And can you kind... Can you remember about when he started the job, around month and year? Hold on. He graduated Iowa May of '18. We sat around for a while. It was probably early, I don't know, call it first quarter of '19. Like January? Yeah. Maybe February, but yes. I know we used to drive up in the snow and stuff. I also know from looking at his taxes his '19 was his highest year of income he's ever had. So, I'd say he worked almost all of '19. And then, up until COVID in '20. Okay. So March of 2020 is when he stopped? Yep. Okay. And did you feel like that job was a good fit for Liam's skills and interests? Yes and no. Okay. Can you tell me why or why not? When we got it down to the stuff that he's good at, yes, he... We're learning he gets very frustrated if he doesn't, can't do something well. So when he started with them, they wanted him to do a little bit more than sweep and clean and load trucks and stuff. And so he was getting frustrated. Once we pieced it together with the employer, like, \"No, it's really okay. We don't really care if all he does is help you load trucks.\" Things got a lot better. So I don't know if that answers your question, but I would tell you that it kind of ties to the supports. When they were there they were trying to basically support him on something, he was probably never going to succeed. He had an iPad, he was supposed to be filling orders almost as if you worked at an Amazon center or something. Yeah. He failed miserably. He fell behind, he wasn't moving fast enough. They were telling him you need to move quicker. He got frustrated with his boss. Yeah. Yeah, together, it was a bad equation. So we basically modified the job. Yeah. And so once you figured out the best way for him to be successful in the tasks that were within his purview, how was it for him then? I don't think he loved the work but he loves the fact that he did go to work and that he was with people. Does that make sense? Yeah. So, he didn't love the work itself, but loved going and socializing and being employed? Yes. Okay. Great. Okay. And let's see, did he participate in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since we spoke last year? No. Okay. And is there anything else you want to tell me or any other updates that you haven't shared yet? Nope. Okay. I think we're good. Well, I would like to say first off, thank you for taking time to talk to me today.\n",
            "finishStart this, this is participant 2025. It's February 19th. Okay, so looking vocational history, he is in the transition program in high school. Correct? Yep. Okay, great. While he was in high school before the transition program? Did he ever have a job? Yes. Mm-hmm . Okay, and about how many jobs did he have? Only one. Okay. Just one job, yeah. Can you tell me a little bit about where that was and what he did? It's his current employer. Okay. So, Chuck E. Cheese. Oh, yes. You wanted to know where, it was in Darien, Illinois. He started off as the check-in person, the Kid Check they call it, and he's worked his way into working in the game room where I guess you can fix the games and the tickets and he loves the mascot. That's his special interest is the Chuck well. Chuck E. Cheese mascot and the Animaronics. So, he's the mascot ... well, no, he's all the time. He'll go in there and dance in. So, he's the mascot? Yeah. Oh, that's fantastic. Yeah. He dances on stage, right? Is that how it works or is it Well, this one, no, but he'll dance ... though it's not on stage, the kids will gather around and he'll dance. Yes. Okay, great. How did he find this job originally? It's a special interest. So he knew exactly through probably the internet and looking around and yeah, I mean. So he found it on his own? Yes, he did. Yeah. Okay. And about how many hours a week does he work? He works about 30. Okay. And do you remember around the month and year when he started? He'd remember-  We'll Double Check with him. You know what I think it's right when he turned 16. Yeah. He wanted the job. So, I think he started in August. Okay.  Seriously he'll know exactly. Let's see. 60 he's 18. So that was four years ago. So 2016. Okay. And you see currently works there? Yep.  Okay. So it wasn't part of school Program?  No. Does or did he receive support while working there? No. No support? No support. Okay.And do you think it's a good fit for his skills and interests? Yes.  Okay. Can you give me some explanation why? He loves skills and interests. He's just very good with kids. He's very good nature. He's very easy going. Doesn't get upset easily and you're in a kid environment and I think because he really loves the Animatronics piece. He's motivated to learn more and to like work on the games and learn how to fix them. Yeah.  Yeah. So is that what he does? And he, with the Animatronics he fixes? Well, he doesn't fix the Animatronics, but like the... They have games there, like a throw the ball in a hole and it gets certain points  Sure. Right. They don't have... They might have pinball, but certain games that are making electronic. Okay. But because he's interested in it, he'll clean the washroom. He'll do whatever he needs to do, which I don't seem doing at all. Excuse me.  Are you all right? Yeah. I don't know if it's the allergies or... I don't think the other people are here yet. We can open the door if that's at all helpful. No, I'm good for now.  Okay. Clean the washrooms and does anything. Really  Yeah, I think he's a little leery of doing the cash register. Okay. Does he or did he volunteer at all in high school? No. Oh, you know what? He was on the yearbook. Do you mean or volunteering at work? Like in the community? No. Okay. Great. Fantastic. That's it for that one.  Okay. That's a quickie.\n",
            "finishAbout his high school situation. So, can you remind me now? I know you mentioned, so when did he graduate from high school, exactly? And what kind of services is he receiving currently? I just need to make sure I put it in here correctly. He graduated or got his whatever it was, because we didn't take his diploma, May of 2020. What were you saying? What services did he get? No. Okay, so then what happened next? He went into the P step program? He didn't in the summer. He started in the fall in the P step program. He actually took a college credit course, finance, that was done online last summer. And then he took the English and the computer class; the welding, which he had to drop. That was in the fall. And then now he is taking the culinary classes. And did his high school plans change or track change at all since we last spoke? Like planning on staying longer but graduated sooner, or he chose to start a transition program when you weren't going to before. Did any of that change? I think the route of the transition changed because of COVID. So, the Project SEARCH was a nine-month program that was going to start in the fall, and that was canceled. So, that changed. And then the P step one online, which... Yeah. So, that kind of changed the plans and the timeline? Yeah. And we've been going back and forth on, do we just take his diploma now and start working with DRS or whatever, but sometimes I'm like, okay, well, if this culinary thing doesn't work, then maybe we really do need to see if they're going to offer this Project SEARCH in the fall, and put him in in the fall. Otherwise, I don't know if hanging onto the diploma or not getting the diploma is helping him or hurting him. I really, I don't know. Okay. Because I don't know if DRS would then take over and do better at that. Mm-hmm . And when is he planning on exiting the transition program in the high school? Or that's... Okay. They don't know. He'll turn 20, so he's only got two more years after that. He turns 20 in July. If he does the Project SEARCH in the fall, then he has to take his diploma upon completion of that, which would be before his 21st birthday. And would the P step program be done then? Is- Yep. Okay. Yep. If he accepts his diploma, then he is out of the district. Okay. I'm just going to leave that blank then because you aren't sure. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, has he worked and left any jobs since we talked last February? So, he just had the seasonal job that his manager actually called him again. She just needs help, like eight weeks during the apple picking season in the fall. So, he worked at a little farm stand, which he did the year before, too. So, it's just seasonal. Okay. And did he get paid for it? Yes. Okay. And- Minimum wage, if that matters. Yep. That's good to know. And how did he find the job? Through his vocational education teacher in high school. And then he went through the application and sent his email on his own and all of that. Okay. And, mm-hmm , go ahead. I don't know if you want a side note on this but as a parent, I think it is incredibly tough to have your kid go and interview for a job when you don't know if, should we disclose that he has disability or not? A lot of bosses don't want parent involvement, but would it help? And I kind of went and talked to the Costco manager once and said, \"Should we disclose this or whatever? Do we come in as a parent?\" And they just don't want parents there. They want the person to be able to tell them that they have a disability. It's just, that has been always been a mucky ground since he was 16. Do I go in and tell them or? As a parent, I just didn't even know what to do. Right. Right. I still don't know. And when he has that job coach liaison person, they will help with that. And they will help with that decision and help you guys talk about it, and they'll probably know the best answer to that as well, in terms of where he's applying. Or they could be the one who helps sort of bridge that conversation topic, you know what I mean? Yeah. Sort of help you with it. Yeah, because I feel like I walk in these stores and there's greeters and there's people who do carts and there's people who check out, and there's people who stock shelves. And he could totally do all that stuff. It's just, he has to realize the importance of having that conversation during an interview, because that, I think he won't get the chance because he's not going to talk. He can't do it. You know? Yeah. But the tasks could be done by him for sure. I wonder how many hours... so back to the seasonal job, how many hours did he work on average when he worked? I understand it was seasonal. Yeah. So, he could work anywhere from four to nine hours in a shift. And it was every Saturday, Sunday for eight weeks. So, there were weekends where he worked 18 hours in a weekend. Mm-hmm . Wow. And the kid just doesn't complain. He just comes home. He's limping around but he'll never say anything. Because he's on his feet for nine hours. But yeah, I mean, his work ethic is really good. Could you tell me a little bit what he did at the job? You mentioned it earlier, but I just need to type it in here. Yeah. So, he was in charge of the kettle corn, so- That's right. Okay. It's something that is purchased by the... people just flock to this farm stand for it. So, he would be popping popcorn, bagging it and putting it on the shelves. And then he actually taught other kids how to do that this year. Wow. The different... how much sugar you have to put in, how much salt you have to put in, all of that. So, he trained? He did. I don't know how... I never saw him do it, but he said that he was teaching other kids how to do it. That's great. What months did he work? When did he start and when did he stop? September, October. Okay. So, all right. And it stops at the end of October? Yes. Okay. Great. And did he get any job support while he was working at this job? No. I did, after he did an interview, I think my husband went and talked to the manager and just said, \"Hey, this is his disability,\" and stuff like that. And, \"Let us know if we can support him at home or talk to him at home to make this job successful for him.\" And she was great. So, she never really... I checked in probably four weeks into it, and he was so thankful just for that opportunity. And I can't even tell you how happy he was going in, and I think he felt a sense of accomplishment that he was doing something outside the home. It was just interesting to him. I mean, it sounds like whatever job, whatever job placement he gets or whatever place he ends up, they're going to be really lucky to have him because he's a worker. I feel like, yes. Yeah. I say that over and over again. I just... Just trying to get past the... Yeah. Just trying to get him there. Yeah. Do you think that the job at the seasonal farm stand was a good fit for his skills and interests? Yeah, I do. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about why? I think the repetition of... made him comfortable with doing that. I think that the manager that was over him kind of knew that that's where his niche was. She put him in other areas and he seemed to always want to go back to doing the whole popcorn area. I think that as far as the distance from our house, we were a little leery because he had to cross a few really kind of busier roads. But eventually, we got to the point where we were comfortable with him going. I think that, it was on the weekend, so he was able to do his homework and schoolwork and stuff during the week, and where he would've been maybe just wasting time playing video games at home, it occupied his time in a productive way, so. Okay. Has he volunteered at all in the community since the last time we spoke? We've done... now because of COVID that's been kind of hard, but we just went over break, over the holiday break, to Feed My Starving Children and packed food, because they were allowing that to happen again. Mm-hmm . Yes. We just did something- He really enjoys doing that, too. Okay. And you went as a family? Yeah. Great. Is there anything else you want to tell us or share? Any updates that we didn't talk about? I don't think so. Okay. Well, that's the last question. The only other thing I ask is if you could just verify your address and email for me. We're kind of collecting that from everyone, so that-\n",
            "finishOkay. So the first questions I'm going to ask you about his vocational activity. I know he's still in high school, correct? Has Adam ever worked during high school? No, not outside of school. He does little jobs at school, but not outside of school. Okay. Does Adam volunteer in the community during high school? No. No. And what are some of those jobs that you said he does in high school? It's not work, but... Right. They do the laundry for the gym classes and he does... He's like the little barista. So he takes all the drink orders and does that, and yeah. At his old school, he made the... He made birthday cards for every student. Oh, That's nice. And put them on their lockers For like spirit or like- Just to be... For every day, just out for all the kids. Yeah. That was nice. Did the students appreciate? Yeah. Yeah, that would be nice. Yeah.  great. Okay. So that was... Those were all the questions because he's in high school, it'll be a lot shorter and he hasn't had experience working. So now we're going to... I know you completed.\n",

He works at an occupational therapy clinic in Forest Park, Illinois. Okay. So does Ryan work at school or in the community? In the community. Okay. So how did Ryan find this job? I arranged for it. How many hours a week on average does Ryan work at this job? Three. What month and year did Ryan begin working at this job? August of 2019. So is this job part of school programming? No. Can you tell me a little bit about the job? Like the job duty. Yeah. He helps straighten up the clinic, and he helps assemble materials, and he empties the dishwasher, and sanitizes. Does Ryan receive support while working? Yes. He has a job coach. So do you think this job is a good fit for Ryan still and interest? For now, yes. Okay. Do you mind telling me a little bit why? Oh, because he enjoys working with his coach and he likes to feel useful. So now we are going to talk about his past high school job. Has Ryan worked and left any job since May 6th, 2021? No. Has Ryan volunteers in the community during high school since last time we spoke? No. Do you have any overall comments want to let us know? No. Okay. All right. So now we go to the last session.

            "finishOkay, thanks. Participants 2023. It's February 17. Great. So we'll start with vocational. Has he ever worked during high school? He had one job in the fall. It was a seasonal job at an apple orchard. So it was eight weeks on the weekends only. And he made Kettle corn and worked in their little general store. Great. Okay. Let me, how many hours, so you said it was on the weekends, for how many hours when he would he work on the weekend? He worked very full shifts, so. Yeah, it could be up to nine hours. A day. Yeah, a day. Yeah. So like 18 hours, he would work Saturday and Sunday? Yeah. There were some rainy weekends, so he didn't get those in, but I would say anywhere from 12 to 18 hours- Okay. Yeah over those two days. ... on a weekend. Yeah. And how did he find this job? Vocational education teacher gave us a flyer and he jumped right on it and did an interview and, yeah. So, okay, great. And remind me again, when did he start? It was the month of September. September. Okay. So September or October. Yeah. It was like an eight week, yeah, seasonal thing. Eight weeks. 2019. Great. You want water? Sure. Okay. And I'm good, thank you. You're good? I have mine right here. And you said the transition or the vocational education teacher gave him the flyer, but was this part of school programming getting this job? No. No. Okay. Okay. Great. So remind me again, you said, so sorry. Because I wasn't at this box yet on my computer. Yeah, that's okay. So he made kettle corn. Mm-hmm . What else did he do? He stocked the shop with kettle corn. I think they found that he's very socially inept, so he enjoyed doing this and he kind of knew his routine. And so they kept him in that capacity and he was happy there. Great. So that's- Yeah, I think they tried him in a few places initially. Yeah. You know, working with the maze- Yeah. Making those apple cider donuts and the maze and stuff like that, but the mazes was a little bit more social. And so he was... I think that's what they found that it was just better. We didn't have a whole lot of communication with his boss. A little bit, but I just kind of checked in with her through email, \"How is he doing?\" And she's like, \"He's doing great. He's got really good work ethic.\" Okay. Put that in here. Did he receive any support while he was doing this job, as in like job coach or? There was nobody designated to him. So if, unbeknownst to us, if there were some people that kind of figured things out and kind of gave him a little hand here and there. Okay. But nothing established ahead of time. Yeah. Right. And nothing formal, no like agencies coming and helping out? No. Okay. Great. And did you think this was a good fit for his skills and interests? It definitely was a... It was his first job, so I, yeah. I thought it was good. Yeah. He enjoyed it and never complained about going, always wanted to go and... Okay. Yeah. I think it gave him some pride and we want him to try again, but he's in tutoring now and he has two different therapies that he does during the week. So we just didn't want to overwhelm him in his last semester. Absolutely. Okay. And did he do any volunteering in the community during high school? He did Feed my Starving Children a few times. He was involved in Key Club for two years in high school. And so we did that. We did a church, some church functions where we painted. It was a long time ago, but. It wasn't in high school though. It wasn't in high school, no. Yeah. For a high school, primarily the Key Club for a couple years. And then the Feed my Starving Children. That's- What is Key Club? It's Kiwanis, so they do cards for military. They do just things for the community, cards for the convalescence centers and things like that. Okay. Coat drive, did they put through a coat drive or a clothing drive or something? A clothing drive? Yeah. Yeah. I've heard of that. Okay. Thanks. Okay. All right. I think he was in that mainly because his sister was the president and she was like, \"Come on, get him in.\" You know what I mean? So like, because when she left and graduated, he didn't really go back. She was the draw. Yep. Okay. All right. Well that's great. Thanks.\n",
            "finishYou could say that, yes. But he's not obviously in school because of COVID. Right, right. Yeah. So the questions I'm going to be asking you for the next two assessments, we're going to pretend like it's before COVID, just because you're about what life was like before everybody had to put on the brakes. All right. Sounds good. Where does he go to school, if you don't mind my asking? I'm also Chicagoan. So I'm always curious about locals. Oh, he was at Camelot School in Mount Prospect. Yeah. Okay. Oh, so he goes out in the suburbs.  Yeah. Okay. Yes, yes. Has he ever worked since he's been in high school? No. Has he ever volunteered during high school? With the school, no. Or even outside of the school? It could be either. No. No? Okay. Great. I'm going to ask you some questions now about services that you may or may not be accessing for geo and whether or not you think they're important. Or not important, whether or not you need them is what I'm trying to say. Sorry. I need to get my head in the game. That's okay. Okay. It's okay. I'm so focused on trying to fix the problem with the computer. I don't know about you, but sometimes I'm like, \"Okay, get it together.\"\n",
            "finishYear where we kind of talked about the activities that he did during the week, like volunteering or work or school. Okay. So the way we're starting this one this time is we're starting with a baseline of his high school experience. And, so I'm just going to ask you a few questions about his high school, even though I know he's not in high school anymore. Can you kind of tell me, did he go to the transition program after high school? When did he graduate? Can you tell me how that all played out? Yes. Immediately after high school for the... He actually did participate in the graduation for the high school. And then he was able to transition into the transition program. And he was there. What was it? 4, 8, 2 years? Four years? Oh my God. I can't even remember now. And I think he finished, I want to say 2018, March of 2018, because it's before you turned  , you have to leave. So they had a graduation for him there. So he did participate in the full experience of the graduating for both. Okay. I heard that Oak Park has a really good transition program. Were you happy with it? Side note. I've just heard a lot of good things about... I actually still keep in contact with his teachers, and they were really great. Really, really great. And I think it's very helpful too, if parents are engaged and participate in the situation where... The teachers can't do everything on their own, so you definitely have to be a part of it and be willing to get information so you can pass it on to them, so they can on the other parents. Oh, that's nice. So there's like a strong community of parents? Yes. Otherwise. Yeah. That's good. And then when he did graduate, did he get, what kind of a diploma did he receive? Did he receive? I'm trying to think. I can't even think now. I don't know if it was his actual diploma. I think it was his actual high school diploma. I'm not mistaken. Okay. All right. Okay, so then for the rest of the interview for this one, we're just going to talk about any academic programs, employment, or volunteering that he may have attended since we saw you last year. And I know he's kind of in a standstill right now. So I guess just generally, can you tell me, what does a typical week look like for Cameron? How does he spend his time right now? Okay. So, normally Cameron is really good about doing house chores and activities. So, he normally wakes up about seven o'clock in the morning. The first thing he does is he feeds the dog, our , and then he will prepare breakfast for himself and his uncle. Once he does that, then normally we'll either check to see if there's laundry that needs to be done. He'll start laundry. And if he doesn't have to do laundry, then he has a normal task where he opens the lines, get the curtains ready for the day to let the sunshine in, or no sun at all. He will help to unload the dishwasher, load it if necessary. And if there's any other chores to do... He'll clean cabinets if they're needed. We just try to do that like once a week, because dust and stuff like that. So he will assist in that. Usually when all his chores are done, maybe about nine o'clock, like nine, 10 o'clock in the morning. So he'll come upstairs and then he likes to play... He has a laptop. So he likes to play like little video games on his laptop, until like maybe 11:00, 11:30, and then he prepares lunch for himself. And usually after that, he has like a website that he likes to go on to check music for different genres. That's one of his things he loves to do. And he'll either call my sister in the afternoon around noon and check on them. And then normally around 3:00, 3:30, he'll feed the dog again and then he'll help to get ready for dinner. So he'll get the dishes out, clean the table off, put away... Help put away groceries if I go to the grocery store. So, he normally has a set routine about what goes on during the day. And if he knows I'm going to the grocery store, he'll go and get the cleaning spray for me to click when I come home to clean the bags off and things like that. Okay. Okay. So, wow. He's really busy. He's really helpful and busy at home. He is very, extremely helpful. Oh, that's so nice. I wish you would come teach my daughter to be as helpful as he is, especially now that we're here together all day, every day. Yeah. Very- That's wonderful. I don't think he even realizes even stuff... I don't know that he pays attention to it. I'm like, \"Oh wow, Cameron, thank you.\" That's wonderful. That's great. That's great that he's not just sitting around, you know what I mean? That he's keeping himself busy at home and doing things. Yes. He's very active and wants to help do whatever needs to happen. He even will do his brother's laundry if they ask him. So... It's wonderful. All right. Well, the only other thing I need to ask you a little bit more about, just because we're collecting it one more time is his job at Culver's. It's just a few details to remind me sort of, and so that we can get in here, what it was like. He was working there, I think, when we saw each other last. And was he being paid at that job? Yes, he was. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about what he did at Culver's? At Culver's he was in the dining area. So, he would clean out the tables. He would set up the napkins and the condiments. And when the guests were finished with their trays, he would take the trays and take them back to get cleaned. And occasionally he would, if during lunchtime, he would take the food out to the guests in the parking area and give them their food. Oh, you there? I lost you. Oh, Can you hear me? Oh, there you are. Mm-hmm . Yes. Okay. Did you hear everything I said? You said you would take the food to people's cars? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Okay. Thank you. And did he receive supports while he was working? Yes, he did have a job coach there. Okay. And a job coach. And were they from DRS? Yes. Well, the job coach was with community support services. Okay. Thank you. And how did he find this job? It was through Oak Park, the transitional program. The site program. Okay. Okay. Great. And on average, do you remember about how many hours a week he was working? He was working about 10 hours a week. Okay. And you told me when he stopped working. Can you remember around the month and year when he started working there? Oh, let's see. I would want to say it was probably February of 2020. Okay. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's not true. It was February of 2018, because it was right before he finished school. Okay, great. Okay. And was it a good fit for his skills and interests, would you say? I think at times it was. There were sometimes when there would be an incident, and I think it was more when it had to do with the customers that would come in, not really probably knowing what to do when a customer maybe had approached him. But if it was a situation where I think if he could, cut up half the apple pie or he was giving a specific task that he had to do, and not a whole lot of customer interaction, I think would be more successful for him. Okay. Thank you. And then... Just see if there's anything else. Has he done any other volunteering or job since we spoke last year? No, not since we spoke. Okay. And then is there anything else you want to share? Any updates that we haven't talked about yet? Hmm. Any updates, any updates? No, I think that's pretty much. That's pretty much what we've been doing since March of 2020. Can you believe it's been a year? Oh my goodness. Yeah.\n",
            "finishGreat. All right. So this is participant 2-0-1-7. It's January 27 and we're going to be talking vocational access interview. Okay. So he is still in high school? Yes. Has he worked at all during high school? Yes. Okay. And about how many jobs has he had? Two. Two. Okay. Did he receive payment for either of those jobs? No. Okay. Of those two is there one that he's working at now or one that he worked at longer than the other? There was one he worked at last summer- Okay. and then there's one he's working now during the school year. So he's been there all school year. Okay. Mm-hmm . What's the name of that one please? The one during the school year? Yeah. He works at Pactiv. Okay. P-A-C-T-I-V. They actually make Reynolds wrap. Oh, okay. So it's like a- It's an office building. An office building. Okay. It's a mail room job. How did he find this job? Through the school transition coordinator. The high school transition coordinator. Great. Okay. About how many hours a week does he work? Six. Five or six. Okay. You said he's doing this all school year so I'm guessing he started around August- Yes. of last year? Yes. Does he currently work there? Yes. Okay, great. All right. Can you tell me a little bit about his job duties? I wish I'd brought his job evaluation because he just had one. Because he just did this. Yes. That's right. He- We can ask him too to fill in the details. Yeah, he works in the mail room, so he delivers mail, picks up mail at collection points. He fills supply cabinets- Mm-hmm . with office supplies. He works in shredding. He does binding reports- Wow. and any other laminating or special work that they have. Okay. Laminating. Laminate. Restocking copy paper office supplies yeah . Okay. Great. Does he receive support while he's working? Yes. Can you kind of tell me a little bit about the type and amount of support? There is a job coach- Mm-hmm . who showed him what he needed to do. Mm-hmm . As he has become more familiar, she backs off more and more. Still either will follow him or shadow him on the rounds for mail. If it's restocking a supply cabinet, he will do most of that independently but she just shadows him- Okay. in case there are issues or questions. One of the other things she works on is his social skills as part of that, if he has questions or if he's pushing the mail cart- Mm-hmm . to say \"excuse me\" if people are blocking his path. Is she there the whole time? Yes. Okay. Is there any support with transportation? How does he get to the job and home? The school provides transportation both ways. A school bus I believe takes him to the job. Okay. Then there is a taxi cab that takes him back to school at the end of the day. Okay. Great. Takes the bus there. Okay. All provided by the school? Yes. Okay. That's great. Okay. It's interesting speaking with different parents how different schools do it differently? Some jump the kids around to lots of different types of jobs- Mm-hmm . and then it sounds like he will be there the whole school year? Yeah, he did interview for a paying job- Mm-hmm . recently, but he did not get that, so. Okay. We did ask for something different here in the second semester- Mm-hmm . just to round out his skillset. Sure. Right. Right. Right. They're looking at the library as a possibility. Okay. So he will be doing something all year. Okay. Okay. Gotcha. Do you think this is a good fit for Alexander's skills and interests? Yes. Okay. Tell me a little why...please? Why is this a good fit for his skills? Well, he likes the office environment. Mm-hmm . He likes to keep moving. Mm-hmm . So being able to walk around, go to different supply cabinets. When there are mailings that need to go out and stuff. It's a very solo job. It doesn't require interaction. It doesn't require talking with somebody else and giving ideas. It's here's my task. I will do it. Go on to the next one. Okay. So that stuff is also very structured. There's a time you go pick up the mail. There's a time and day that you check the mail, the cabinets to restock things. There's a checklist and math you have to do for how many pens do they have now? Okay. How many of you added, what's the total? How many? You know that type of stuff. He does well with those types of very- Mm-hmm . structured environments? Yes. Okay. Okay. Did he volunteer or does he volunteer at all during high school? He does not. Okay, great. Thank you.\n",
            "finishWe are going to talk about some of the activities Alexander's been involved in now, and we're starting off this part of the interview with everyone by talking about high school. So you've kind of mentioned it, I'm just going to ask you to do it one more time. Can you describe Alexander's high school situation and is he still in high school or receiving services through the school system? Yeah, so he is still receiving services through the school system. He was a senior physically in the school last year, getting his certificate in May of 2020. And there was more of an academic orientation to what he was doing in the high school than he's currently getting within the transition program. All right, and did his track or plans change his high school tracker plans change since we last spoke? No. And when is he planning on exiting completely? That means including the transition program that he's in now. Age 22. Okay. So he's 19. So he'll be, . Three years. Is it 2023 then? Yeah.  Okay. May, Oh, no, I'm sorry. Not may. When is his birthday? January 14th, he just turned 19. Got it. Okay. So January 2024. Yes. So I have to ask you this, is he currently working? No. And why is he not currently working? COVID right? COVID, yeah. So, I will tell you, we just got an email today that they're looking to get back out into the community and doing some job training stuff. Okay. Very soon. So, I mean currently, no, but they're looking to actually. At his last update meeting couple weeks ago, they talked about an opportunity for him to work in the stock room of a retail store. So unpacking boxes, shipments of new items, unpacking them and organizing, but we don't have a time yet or timeline. Definitely hope it's in the next few weeks. Okay. Well, that's good to hear. I love it, it's so hopeful. Anytime I hear about something returning somewhat to normal. Yes. Has he worked and left any jobs since we spoke last year? Not paid, no, or even unpaid. Once the job at the office, the mail room supply, ended because of COVID he didn't do any other work. So he was at the mail room when COVID hit though, right? Yes. I'm just going to ask a few questions about that because they want it in here. So where was the mail room, was it still at that packed office building? Yes. And how did he find that job? Through the high school, had part of their Community, I don't want to say community outreach, but vocational coordinator got him that job and they worked with NSSCD to provide a job coach. And can you remember about how many hours on average he worked at this job? Eight hours a wee And can you remember about when he began working there? Would've been the fall of 2019. So September, 2019? Yeah. About, and then he stopped in March when COVID hit? Yes. Thank you. And can you just remind me a little bit about what types of things he did at this job? Yeah, he would sort mail, deliver mail. He would restock supply cabinets with office supplies, paper, pencils, pens, that type of stuff. He would assemble binders for presentations or things like that if they were needed That's about it. And he received support job coaching from NSSCD? Yes. How often, or do you know what types of supports did they provide? Well, and as he, first started the job, it was, direct instruction and teaching him. And as he got more comfortable with the job, here's the schedule of what we're doing. And he would go do the task himself with less oversight. The job coach was usually nearby, but he worked to become more and more independent in doing that. Like, it's Thursday, what does the schedule say? Check the supply cabinet. so let's go do that. He would go off and do that once he had been shown, count the number of pens that are in there, do we need more pens? Yes or no. And fill up the form and move on. It's too bad. And he, he was making progress and becoming more independent and then  everything had to stop. Did you think the job was a good fit for him, for his skills and interests? Yes. Why? Well, Two reasons I guess, would be, it was minimal personal interaction, and it used his, his organization and counting skills. And, I guess, the other thing would be that it also forced him to start to develop some of his personal interaction capabilities. Example; in the beginning, when he was pushing the mail part through the hallways, he would just kind of, sort of push through people. If two people were in the hallway, he would just start to push the cart between him and the coach said, no, you have to stop and you have to say, please, excuse me. And so, normally he wouldn't want to interact with people like that. That was why it was a good fit, because it was forcing him to learn those, life skills that he will need. Has he volunteered in the community, since we last spoke at all? Boy we've tried, but no, because of COVID he hasn't been able to. He desperate really wanted to. What's that? I said we desperately wanted to, to give him something else to do, but nobody's taking it.  I know, there's just only a few places where you can volunteer at least here in Chicago that I know of. Everything's sort of, it's still really locked down. Is there anything else you want to tell us, or any other updates you want to share that you haven't before? No, not that I can think of. Well thanks for giving me your time today. I really appreciate it. Before we go. I just will.\n",
            "finishWe have two more, and this one will be short since Sawyer is still in high school. We're going to talk about employment and volunteering activities during Sawyer's involvement in high school. So you said Sawyer is still in high school? Yeah. Has Sawyer worked during high school? No. Did Sawyer volunteer in the community during high school? Sometimes we'll bring him to food bank at our... Or something like that, where they're collecting bags for the food pantry. But that's about the only volunteer work that he does. Okay. Great.\n",
            "finishOkay. Vocational interview with youth, participant 2007, January 7th, 2020. What about the drawing animation class? Why is that a good fit for you? Because I like to see cartoon characters and expect to know how they would look if I made them on paper. Okay. All right. Do you have any other comments about this program that you want to add? No? Okay. All right. Now let's talk about your job at Home Depot, okay? Do you feel that this job is a good fit for you? Well, I mean, in school, it might be okay. Okay. Can you tell me a little more why? Because you get to return the items with an app. Why did you say it's a good fit for school? Probably because it helps other students too, apart from me itself. Why is it a good fit for you? Because I feel as if I am learning how to put items away in the correct spot. Do you like using the app? Yeah. Do you feel comfortable using the app? Okay, shoot. Okay. Are you still working there? Yeah. Okay. And do you have any other comments about your job at Home Depot that you want to add? I hope to work independently after graduating. Would you like to work independently at Home Depot? Yeah. Okay. I think that's it. We're done.\n",
            "finishOkay. All right. It's working. Participant 2005, January 20th, 2020. So for the recycling, about how many hours a week on average do you think he worked at the job? I know it was in school, but do you have an idea? I would say five hours a week. Probably about an hour each day it took. And do you know, by any chance, when he started working at that job, maybe? He probably, he worked it out at a year or so. Okay. Halfway through one school year and through the summer until he finished. Okay. So can we try to think back when that would be, like what year? I'm trying to think of the . I think it was like Just over a year and a half. So I'm trying to remember when he started telling me about it. I think he started doing it occasionally with him learning it in May of 2018. Okay. That works for me. And then he stopped. When did he stop working there? When he aged out of the school, November 18th of 2019. You remember exactly. Must be his birthday. The day before his birthday. Oh, of course. Right, right, right. Okay. And that was at school. Was that part of school programming, working that job? Yeah. Okay. And while he was doing the recycling, did he receive support by teachers or job coaches? By teachers. Okay. Were they with him the whole time? Sometimes? Do you know? No. As he went into each classroom, an aid or a teacher in that classroom would support him and make sure he did everything that needed to be done in each classroom, if he seemed like he needed a reminder and help. He was one of the only students allowed to walk the hallways without a teacher. Okay. Do you think this was a good fit for his skills and interests? Yeah. He enjoyed it. So he enjoyed it. What are some other ways that this might have been a good fit for him? He enjoyed the job. Anything else you want to add? Yeah. He liked the little bit of independence he got. He was the only... I want to put that in there. He was the only student allowed to walk the halls by himself. Yeah. Okay. Did he do any volunteer work in the community during high school? No. Okay. Okay. So for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask you about academic programs, employment, and volunteering that he may-\n",
            "finishLast time we spoke, we discussed some of the activities Michael had been involved in. I know he was still in high school then, and he is now. And at the time he was working, I think, at the school cafeteria a couple days a week. So that's kind of where we're going to start is talking about high school. So can you kind of describe his high school situation and when he plans to exit the transition program? Well, transition, he goes to until may of 2022. Thank you. Okay. And when did he graduate from regular high school? 2018. I don't know. 2018. I know, right? 21, 22. 18, I guess. Okay. These days, everything kind of blends together. Did his high school track or plans change at all since we spoke last? Did what? Did your plans for his high school, time in the transition program change at all since we last spoke or is it the same? It's the same. Okay. All right. And 2022. Okay. And has Michael worked and left any jobs since we last spoke last January? Nope. Not just besides what they were doing at school. Okay. And has he volunteered in the community during high school since the last time we spoke? Has he what? Volunteered in the community. No. Okay. And the job was he working at... So he was at the school cafeteria, right? When we spoke last. Yeah, they worked in the school cafeteria. They went and they worked on a farm. They went to McDonald's. There was a restaurant they would work at. Okay. And did he get paid for those jobs? No. Okay. Great. All right. And is there anything else you'd like to tell me or share any other updates that we didn't talk about already? No, not really. Nothing going on. I know. Right? Okay. Great.\n",
            "finishAll right. So last time we spoke, a year ago, we talked about some of the activities that Christian had been involved in. We'd like to hear what he's doing now. And we're starting this part by talking about high school. I know he's out of high school. When did he age out of the transition program? Can you remember when exactly that was? Yeah. It was November 18th of 2019. Okay. Did he go directly into the school's transition program after high school? Yeah. Okay. You've already answered that, sorry. Thank you. You answered most of these for me already. And he got a certificate of completion. Now, enough about high school. So for the rest of this short interview, I'm going to ask about any kind of academic programs, employment, or volunteering that he's attended since we spoke last year. And I think you said nothing really has changed. Can you tell me a little bit about what does a typical week look like for Christian and how has he been spending his time?  at home, play video games, going for walks, make for himself lunch and hanging out with his cousin and a friend on occasion. Once or twice a month, they go out and spend a day together. Okay. Does he do any volunteering? No. Okay.  you answered that already. I think that's it for this one. Let me just make sure I ask this just in case I didn't hear it right. Is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college, college or university since we spoke last? No. Okay. Is he at all currently participating in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities? No. Okay. And is there anything else you want to tell me? Any updates that you didn't share, that we didn't talk about? No. Okay. Well-\n",
            "finishOkay. Great. So this is Participant 2003, vocational interview. Okay. Don't worry about the crunching. It's fine. Oh, okay. This is just for double, just in case I miss anything. Okay. Okay. So first question is just, we're going to talk about employment and volunteering activities that Brendan was involved in during high school. Okay. Is he still in high school? He's in transition, which is the after high school program. Okay. And did he work at all during high school? Mm-hmm . Does he have a high school diploma or a- He graduated high school, but they don't give it to you until you're done with transition. Got it. Got it. Thank you for getting my phone in case she texts. Okay and how many jobs did he have during high school? Probably one junior year and one senior year. Okay. And did he get paid for either one of those, or both? He did, but it went straight to the school, I think, because they had a coach with him the whole time. So I think the school pays him and they pay him minimum wage, if not even less. Okay. Because he would get checks from the school district for like $8. But they would cut him a check? Mm-hmm  Right. Okay. But it would be a very small amount. All right. So was there, of the two jobs, was there one that he held the longest more than the other while he was in high school? We'll have a chance to talk about the ones after in a minute. While he was in high school, it wouldn't just be him, but all of the kids or a lot of the kids had a job cleaning the condo buildings, like the hallways and stuff, vacuuming and cleaning the windows. Okay. And that would be like where he worked the longest probably during high school? Yeah, they do that the whole year high school, but it's not like they have a choice, because that's what they do. Was there a name of the company? No, it's just something through the high school. Through the high school. Great. Okay. And how did he find the job? The school sets it up. It's like all of the kids have that job at one point or another. Okay. Great. Goldfish and being recorded is probably not a good idea. That's okay. I never think about that when I snacks, but we can hear through it. During high school, how many hours a week did he work at this job, on average? Oh, maybe one or two. And can you remember what month and years he began working at the job? Graduated in 20, So it would be 2015. Probably the beginning of the school year? No, probably in February or March of 2016? No, wait. Yeah, February or March of 2015. Okay, great. So, okay, and does he currently still work cleaning condos? No, no, no. Okay. And can you remember when he stopped working at that job? June of 2015. Great. I guess my question is, was this a place in the community, or was it these were condos out in the community, right? Correct. Okay. But the school already has a contract set up with the condo association. Okay. Saying our kids are going to come in once a week on this day and they're going to vacuum the lobby and clean the windows in the lobby. Okay. So it was already, it's something every kid there does, so they can get used to actually going to a job. Great. And so yes, part of school programming. Okay. So he would go in and clean the condos. What kinds of jobs do you remember, or duties did he have while cleaning the condos? Well, it wasn't the condo. It was the lobby of the condo. Oh, lobby, lobby, lobby. And it was just vacuuming and then cleaning the windows and that's all they did. Apparently, I don't know how to spell vacuum. There's two U's, which is weird. That would be what I forgot. And only one C, apparently. It's a very weird word. Did he have a job coach? Mm-hmm . Did he get support? Definitely. Was the job coach there the whole time? Yes. Did they take public transportation, or how did he get to the building? Then, they used the high school buses. They had the small little white buses. Okay. And the job coach was with them at all times? Uh-huh . Okay. Did you think this was a good fit for Brendan's skills and interests? No, but it gave him- Can you tell me more on that? He likes to be out around people. He likes to be moving all the time. He likes to be out in the public. So he'd probably do better at a social job. Yep. Yep. Okay. Did Brendan volunteer in the community at all during high school? We tried the food pantry. Okay. But his thing is expiration dates and going into a food pantry, they thought it would be great, because he can check the expiration dates, but 90% of the food in the food pantry is expired. What would happen? He would tell the people that they shouldn't take it and eat it because it's expired, so we had to move him out of there. Yeah. I just, yeah, that was a bad idea. Yeah. Okay, does he clean out your refrigerator? On the daily. Every day. Every day. My refrigerator or anybody's house we go to, their refrigerator. When we go to the grocery store, he still does all the expiration dates. Yeah. So that really is his thing. He won't let me have anything with the word baby on it, because we don't have babies in the house. Ah, got you. Yeah. So, Sweet Baby Rays, baby carrots. So no barbecue sauce. Baby pickles. Okay. Baby oil. Nothing with the word baby on it. So yeah, so I'd give my expired stuff, I'd either bring it to work or I give it to my brother or something. Oh, that's funny. So have you stopped buying things with baby on them, just because you already know ahead of time? Yeah. Not worth the fight. So then and like toothpaste has an expiration date. Everything has an expiration date and it's like, \"It doesn't go bad.\" \"But it's expired.\" Yeah. So yeah. Yeah, because he can't grasp the idea that you're really just not supposed to sell it past that date. If it says sell by on it, he's okay with it. Okay. So he does, yeah. Yeah. Well that was a lesson we learned down the road was that if it says sell by or best by, there's two different things. So, and sometimes they just have an expiration date, so yeah. Okay. Water, soda, beer. Everything. Everything has an expiration date. I guess it does, doesn't it? I had girls over that I worked with and one of them bought a case of Bush beer over. He found it and dumped them all out because they had expired. Are you serious? Uh-huh . Oh, so much for that party, right? He laughed. Yeah. That's good. That's all you can do. Yeah, that's all you can do. Yeah. Okay, so we're going to spend the rest of this interview talking about what he did after high school. Okay. So first, I'd like to get an idea of how he usually spends his time, so like activities that he participates in during a typical week. That could include employment, volunteering, anything, academics, but we're not going to look at leisure for just this moment. Oh, he goes T99, Monday through Friday from... The bus picks him up at 7:30 and he's home at about 3:00. Okay. And during that time he just started, he works at Walgreens on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30 to 11:30. Okay. Okay. They don't hire though, so that's not something that'll stay in place. Okay. And then he just started at a place called, Now, and that is Wednesdays from 8:00 to 10:00. And this is all through the school program that he's at these places? Right. And he goes to the YMCA through school. I'm not sure how many days he goes. I thought it was two, but it seems to be more. He would know. Okay and I will ask him, yeah. And that's it. That's what he does. Okay. Great. Okay so currently he's in... Okay, so here it says like please select the activities currently in. So what I've heard you say so far is he's not in a post-secondary education program. He's in a transition program. Right. Okay. Would you call it a vocational training program? No. No. Okay. Working for pay with support? Mm-hmm . So that would be him. Yep. And currently, is he doing any volunteering in the community? No. Okay. Great. Okay, so how many hours, total hours, and you can take a guess on this, do you think during the average week, does he spend participating in all of these vocational activities? The educational activities? Six hours during the day, so six times five's 30. About 30. Okay. And that's estimating. This is just, this computer is a little fickle. Okay, sorry. That's okay. There we go. Okay, so going back, so he was at Walgreens and these are all part of school and he's also working in a place called, Now. Can we move backwards from Walgreens to high school? Where are the places that he's worked? So before Walgreens, can you remember? He was at Jewel. He was at the Jewel, the one that he just got fired. Okay. And do you remember the dates? He was there from... He got let go in June, so he was there from probably May the year before. Okay. So he was let go in June of 2019, so he started in May of 2018. 2018, okay. And then how about before that? Before Jewel, he was at Walgreens. And he was at Walgreens from, I would roughly say September of 2017 until maybe, March of 2018. Okay. Before that, he worked at Mojo's and that was probably maybe three months during 2017. Okay. So probably the beginning of 2017, like May, April or March of 2017. And then before that, he was at TJ Maxx, and he was there for maybe three months in 2016. Okay. And then I don't think he worked anywhere else other than the school stuff, like the apartment condo. Okay. And then- That was during high school though, right? Mm-hmm . The condo cleaning? Right. Okay. That's it. It bring us here. Okay. Thank you. That's really helpful. Okay. So now the next part of this asks a little bit about the school programs that he attended after high school. So it's difficult, because I think the transition's part of the high school, correct? Yeah. It's not a community program. Mm-hmm . Okay. Okay. So I'm going to say- He did get into the Eagles program. Do you know what that is? It's an adult's day program. Okay. That's through the Darien Park district, long waiting list to get in, but he went there one day. It was fine. Went there another day, because they have to see if he fits in the group. Went there, this would be after transition. They were like, okay, we can, they have to accept him. Went there once, it was fine. Went there a second time, it was fine. But then he found out that this is possibly something he would do after transition. He didn't want anything to do with it. He totally sabotaged it because he was like, no, I'm not going there, because there was other special needs adults and he doesn't want anything to do with special needs adults. So he totally sabotaged it. And he said he's not going and he would raise a ruckus when he went there again, the third time and the woman said, \"Okay, we can't take him.\" He likes working. He likes making money and that's what I'll tell you. \"I want to make money. Lots and lots of money.\" Okay. He loves NASCAR. Great. Goldfish are really good. I haven't had it in so long. Thanks for sharing. Oh, no problem. I'm glad that you wanted snacks. I just brought those in today. Oh. So can we just real briefly talk about each one of these jobs- Sure. ... A little bit. So can you tell me a little bit about, we'll move backwards. Starting now with this place now, what are some of the activities? He hasn't actually started there yet. Okay. But from what I understand, he is putting boxes together for shipping. Okay. There is another boy there that went to T99 that he knows that does that job. And does he receive any supports? Yeah. Oh, he'll have a job coach with him. A job coach? Mm-hmm . Okay. Oh yeah. It's far though. It's really far. It's at Lake and it's at Gary and 390, so it's up in Roselle. So it's not close and we're in Downers Grove. How does he get there? Pace, the Pace bus. You take the Pace, with the job coach? It happens that the job coach actually lives right there by Now, so she's going to meet him there. And he can take the bus on his own? Yeah. Yeah, because they pick up at the door and they drop off at the door. Great. Okay. Is he paid? Yeah. I don't know what. I don't really care what, but he'll be paid, yeah. Okay, Great. And what about at the Walgreens? He checks expiration dates. And I'm assuming with support? Should I keep asking or should I assume he had job coaches through all of these? He had job coaches at most, except for the Jewel. Because the Jewel, he actually got the job on his own and they still set a job coach, but he was paid from Jewel. Oh. Yeah, they paid him minimum wage and everything. That's amazing. It was great. It just killed me that he lost that job. And what was he doing at the Jewel? Checking expiration dates. Expiration dates. What would he do? Would he create a list? He'd have a cart and they would tell him what section to go into and he would pull out everything and then he would put things back in order of expiration date and I mean literally, down to the seconds. And then, if something was expired he would take it off the shelf? Yeah and he'd put it on the cart. Okay. Similar at the Walgreens? Yep. Same thing, except he would write, he would have to take a Sharpie and write 1506 on it. So now when he does something at my house that's expired, he has a Sharpie and he writes 1506 on it. What's 1506? I guess that means it's expired. Okay. It's a code. Yeah. Special code. It's code. Okay. What about and so when he worked at Walgreens in 2017- Yes, he did the same thing. ... Kind of same thing. Okay, great. What about Mojos? What do he do there? Mojo's was clearing tables. Is that a restaurant? Yeah. Okay. It's really good, Philly cheese steaks. I mean he filled up condiments. Okay. It's real small. I mean the whole place is probably as big as, that we're in this room together. Yeah. Okay. Job coach there? Yeah. Okay. How about TJ Maxx? Oh, that was the worst. They would get shoes in and they would be in the back room and they would have to check to make sure the shoes were the same size and then put them back in the box. Hated it. He hated that job. Well it's isolated. Yeah. Right? Away from people. Yep. Before selling. Okay, and was he paid? He's been paid for all of these jobs? Yeah. But like I said, TJ Maxx, Mojo's, Walgreens, they were all paid. We would get a check from the school district. From the school. Jewel was the only one that's different. Right. Because he got that one on his own. Well, yeah, they came up to me and it was like, Hey, because he would go in there and check the expiration dates, but they didn't have, their manager wouldn't job coach. And then they got a new manager whose wife is a special ed teacher and they just loved him. Oh my gosh, they loved him. And the girl that he took- So they recruited him? They looked for me when I went in there. The woman comes up and she's like, \"Hey.\" She's like, \"Did you find anything for us today?\" And Brendan walks up and he's like, \"Here, six bags of M&Ms.\" And she gets on the phone and calls the manager's down and the manager tells me that they're creating a position just for him. Okay. And fill out an application. And then I went in a week later and they're like, \"Yeah, we were looking at you. We had a job fair and we were waiting for you to come in.\" I'm like, \"I didn't know anything about it.\" Because the transition 99 job woman was kind of a- Yeah. So she didn't tell us. But we live right there so when we went back in, Eric, the assistant manager, was like, \"We were looking for you.\" Wow. That must have felt good for him. I'm sorry about what ended up happening, but at that moment. Yeah. And it was just him not understanding social cues. I mean, there was a girl that came in and she had a cane because she has a prosthetic leg from the knee down who Brendan went to high school with her. And I guess the girls are known for coming in the Jewel for being assholes. So they come in there and everybody knows who they are and they cause a ruckus every time they do. And Brendan went up, and to him, flirting is like, I'm going to take your glasses, or I'm going to take your hat and I'm going to take your cane. And she got all pissed. \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\" That's what he did? That's what he did. He grabbed her arm and said, \"I'm sorry.\" And then she started screaming and then the manager, front end girls at the counter, went up and it was like, \"What?\" And then the girl started screaming at the girls that work there and then she posted it on Facebook and it was like, you fucking bitch, do you realize what you just did? You destroyed every dream that he had. So yeah, so I've been trying to fight it and trying to find the girl and everything. And I can't do anything. Good luck with that. Yeah. I know. I appealed it and they're supposed to tell me again in January, but I haven't heard anything. And even the manager told him, \"I'll hire him back. I'll take him back.\" All the girls there were crying when... All the girls at the front desk were crying. The manager was crying. The assistant manager was crying. That Jewel Osco guy manager was crying. They were all like, \"I just can't believe this.\" Yeah. So it'd be perfect if we could get him a job there again. Get him back in there. I don't, but Jewel's like, \"Hey he touched somebody. That's the first thing in the rule book. Don't touch anybody.\" And he knows not to do that now. Oh yeah. I'm sure. But I don't know. Well, I mean, if you know anybody who can help me, but I did try to get a hold of Arc. Yeah. And they were like, \"Yeah, unfortunately that's what it says in the rule book.\" And I was like, fuck. That's number one. Yep. Yep. Too bad it was her and not somebody who was a little more understanding. Yeah. And she went to high school and she has a prosthetic leg, so she knows. Yeah. So, I'm like whatever. So anyway. Has he participated in any other employment, vocational, or volunteering since leaving high school that we didn't cover? I don't think so. No, I don't think so. We tried the Humane Society, but they'd have to go through training and it wasn't something that I could do with him. Right. And that's a lot of it, is that he would do a lot more, but I don't have time to do stuff with him like that. I just, I don't have time. That's why he needs a personal support worker. Exactly. All right. I'm going to stop this, because we can-\n",
            "finishAll right, this is participant 2002, February 20th. We're going to start with vocational index. All right. Jessica's still in high school, right? She just turned 16, correct? Mm-hmm . Okay. Has she ever worked while she's been in high school? At the school on the coffee cart and I think another place, I forget what it's called in school. Okay. So the coffee cart and then one other job? Yeah. I mean, that's part of the program that she's on. Part of the program. Okay. Mm-hmm . She was even employee of the month. Two months in a row. Oh, good for her. I'm going to put that in here. Did she get paid for any of this or? It sounds like she did, but I think they keep it at school. I don't know if... I know she got a $5 bonus when she was employee of the month. Okay. Twice, but, and once she said she bought something with money she made at the school. She had like a Mickey Mouse puzzle, so I don't know. Okay. That was part of the... Program. It's called Career Life Skills. Thank you. Okay. So it's part of school. I'll type as fast as I can, just bear with me. Okay. So about how many hours a week do you all know, does she work doing her jobs around the school? I don't know. I would say zero to five. Okay, great. But I have no idea. And when did she start working these jobs? This year. The beginning of this school year. This school year. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to ask a few questions about this. So you said first one, you said was coffee cart. Can you describe to me either one of or both, what kind of duties does she have when she runs the coffee cart? Honestly, I have no idea. Okay. We have to ask her. I know one of the things is she's... That they say is that the teacher said that she's good at letting them know when they're running low on like the different flavorings. Okay. That she's on top of that. And so maybe she's= I'm going to make a... Maybe she keeps the coffee cart stocked? Yeah. Okay. And she said she can do the money without a calculator, I believe she said. So we're thinking that she charges, I'm guessing the teachers, but I'm not going to put that in there because we don't know. So she keeps track of money? It sounds like, yeah. When they pay her, she doesn't need a calculator to figure out the change. Yeah, I wish she was here. She could answer these questions. Oh, she'll... Jessica. Christina will ask her when she comes down. So when she comes down, Christina will talk to her a little bit about some of this. So she'll fill in the details. Without a calculator. Does she receive, oh and then what's the other one? You said coffee cart. And you said something else? I think it's where they sell spirit wear, but I forget what they call it. You'd have to ask her. Oh, like a school store? I think. I know nothing about that. Okay. I'll just put it in here and let her fill in the details. How's that sound? Okay. And then when she's doing these jobs, does she have support, like a job coach or someone? I assume. I don't know. Well there's definitely teachers or supervisors. Okay. Yeah. For sure. Okay. Do you guys, do you think that this job, we'll just focus on the coffee cart, is a good fit for her? Sounds like it. She was employee of the month twice. Sounds like it. Right? Exactly. So can you give me a little bit, so- The said she picked it up quick because it was the first year doing it. I mean, honestly I know very little about it. Mm-hmm . Because it's in school, right? Yeah. I'm going to put, \"You know, very little about it. You feel it's a good fit because she won employee of the month.\" I mean that's, right? That's evidence right there. Great. Thank you. Does she volunteer in the community during high school or has she at all? No. No, no. Okay. The most is like at the bowling she would sometimes help carry the bowling ball to a ramp. Because some of the kids needed the bowling ramp. When they're bowling? Yeah. But that's on Saturdays and she was doing it, but I haven't seen her do it recently. Okay. But she had in the past. Thank you. Perfect. Great.\n",
            "finishSo you mentioned earlier that she is still in high school? Yes. Did her graduation plans or high school track or plans change since the last time we spoke in August 2020? No. So when is she planning on graduating high school or leaving the school system? 2022. Would that be May? Yes. I hope I'm saying that, right. No, wait a minute. This is 2021, no, 2023. I'm... Should be in, let me make sure I'm calculating. So in August, this August, she'll be a senior, that'll take her to 22. So then she'll go to, yeah she'll go to college in August 2022. There we go. Okay. And would she graduate? What year do you, or what month do you think that she will graduate? May. Okay. And is she, and you said earlier that she's not currently working? No. Are there reasons that she is not currently working, this is just something that we ask of all participants? Oh, it is just that it's hard to get her to a job and then me to get to my job and get her back and that, and I really rather her, if she got something it would be in the summertime. So I'd rather her focus on her school right now, on her classes. Cause it takes her a little bit longer to process things. I don't want her to stress out about trying to go to work. Of course. So has she worked and left a job since the last time we spoke in August? No. And what about volunteering in the community during high school since the last time we spoke? She did during the holidays a little bit, but they wouldn't let her do that too much because of COVID, but that's about it. She's done more volunteer stuff before, prior to that, prior to COVID. And where was she volunteering? So it is with the sorority it's called Delta Sigma Theta. And they would, part of participation in having fun was to do like food drives or clothes drives. Then of course, depending on the season they would do little things and then go to the retirement home and just spend time with folks that were there, people that were there. So she did that with the sorority. That's great. But again, that was before. Yeah, that was before COVID though. She hadn't been able to do all that, but she has been able to do like the food bank for Christmas for a little bit. Okay. Are there any other updates that you would like to tell us about or anything that you would like to share with us? Yeah. So she's being more social now. She's engaging people more, her peers. So she's doing that. She's supposed to go to the prom next Saturday. Oh, that's so exciting. She's excited about it. Yeah. I think she's narrowed her subject down.  school goes to Biology. She likes biology, so she likes chemistry, but I think she's narrowing it down to Biology now. That's wonderful. She wants to. Yeah. Well.\n",
            "finishJust wanting to confirm that she is still in high school. And confirming kind of what you said earlier, she's not currently working? No. This is just something that we asked to all families, why is she not working at this time? I haven't pushed her to work. And it's just a thing of, okay, she's working, she's going to have to get there, and it's difficult to... Again, I take her to school in the morning and then I have to pick her up at 2:30, so I have to drive from  area. And I'm still on the clock, so I have to hurry up and work from home. It's just, it would be too hectic unless it's something that's a weekend thing, and I haven't researched it and I haven't had her research it either. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, that does sound it would be really hectic. Mm-hmm . And I'm assuming she's not worked and left any job since the last time we spoke? Okay. Right. And what about volunteering in the community? Has she done that? She has not done that. Okay. Because again, that's like, I would have to get her there, and... Mm-hmm. And so now we'll move on to talking about-\n",
            "finishOkay. So now we'll talk about some activities that he might be involved in. And so you mentioned that he has graduated high school since the last time we spoke, is he currently involved in a transition program or any services through the school system? Not through the school system, no. Okay. And you said he graduated in May? Yes. Okay. And, so for this section, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he may have been involved in since the last time we spoke in April. But first I'd love to know what a typical week looks like for him. So what does a typical typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? He spends his time between my house and his dad's. He has chores at home, he does not like leaving home, he's not a agoraphobic, but as with most autistic adults, he would rather spend time by himself. He does have social meetings over gaming systems with friends here from school that I know. I make him come down and participate in dinners and chores, and when we have company, but since there's no job for him currently, and for about eight weeks of his summer he was helping me after knee surgery, his life is pretty isolated. Yeah. I know it's been a really isolating to time for everyone right now. And so just confirming, he's not been enrolled in an academic program since the last time we spoke in April? Or a job, or vocational, or volunteer activity? That's correct. Okay. And so now- His volunteer hours for testing  were done online. Were done online, okay. And what did his volunteering look like with Tennessee Promise? It's basically watching videos about Tennessee promise, watching videos about starting school and doing things. It was very, very difficult to get the eight hours because he did not want to sit and watch them, he just didn't want to do it. So that was a struggle. We got it done but since he's not attending school, I'm just assumed that we've lost Tennessee Promise. So he's no longer doing that.\n",
            "finishEarlier, you mentioned that he is in high school. Correct? Yes. He's in the high school. And did his plans or graduation track change since the last time we spoke? I know you mentioned that he... Did his graduation plans change since the last time we spoke? Yes. I want him to repeat the 11 grade one more time. Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . And so when is he planning on exiting high school or exiting the school system? What you say again? When? Yeah. What month and year is he planning on leaving the school system? I'm not understand 100% that question. Yeah. Sorry about that. So when is he planning on graduating? Oh, he need to repeat 11. And after that he need to do a 12. So that would be, let's see, would that be 2020- '22, '23. '23. And would that be, do you think, the month of May? Uh-huh . Okay. To the high school. And I hope I find, to get a application to him for go to, to  program, either ones. And I know if he have available to, for make application for the programs, too, that he can pay too much. Yes. Can- And so- The financial aid. What you say again? Yeah, financial aid. . Yeah. Mm-hmm . You said earlier, he's not currently working. What you say again? You said earlier, he doesn't have a job right now. He's not currently working? No. No, because he needs training. Mm-hmm . And earlier you mentioned that he hasn't worked since the last time we talked in August, either. Mm-mm . And has he volunteered in the community since the last time we talked? Yes. He go to clean the church one time's a month. They're happy to him, for to clean the church. That's so nice. Okay. And so, is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates you would like to share with us? No. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today, as this would not be possible without your participation, and we really appreciate it. Thank you so much. Thank you. And so-\n",

No. He no have... What about volunteering in the community? He go to Capital  to clean the church.  Oh, he cleans the church? That's great. Yeah, he can go to Capital to clean the church.

Actually next Saturday, the 15th she graduates. Oh, wow. That is so exciting. So graduating this week. Wow. And earlier you mentioned that she's not currently working? No, she's not. And this is just something we ask to everybody, but what are the reasons that she's not currently working? Well, right now we haven't applied for anything right now. I wanted her to focus on finishing up school and then we would look at finding something that she's interested in doing and start with some part-time work or something there just to work her into it. And has she worked and left any job since the last time we spoke in August of 2020? No. And has she volunteered in the community during high school since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share? No. I think we're pretty much in the same  and work.

And so in terms-\n",
            "finishSo, is he still in high school? Yes. Well, he graduated, but he's able to go to school until he is 21. And so we're allowing him to continue going. I'll write that down. And has he ever worked during high school? No. No. And what about volunteering in the community? Only if I do stuff with the men's group, like during the wintertime, we have people at our church that... We live out in the country and some of our older people, they have wood burning stoves, but they're no longer able to go cut their own wood. And so a lot of times the men's group will be putting back quarts of wood throughout the year and we'll take wood out to some of the houses and we always make him, make sure that he's involved with that. And he's very helpful as far as carrying the wood to the sheds and getting them filled up. And he'll go and help his partner  pick up sticks and stuff, when he's been mowing different yards, he'll go and pick up the sticks and all that kind of stuff and bring them to the burn pile. Oh, that's so nice. Okay. I'll write that down. Okay. And how long has he been kind of helping bringing wood out to people's houses? We've been doing that... So it's been about six years that I've had him... Because a lot of times before the last two years it was either me or her was home. It wasn't very often we were both going together because someone had to be here for him. And so, if I was going to get involved with something like that, I would bring him along with me because he needed that to learn how to do that. He needed to learn to be selfless and do things for other people. Well, that's great. And also I just wanted to clarify too, is this high school, is he involved in a transitions program or is this just the high school that he was at before and he's just staying there? He's just staying. Okay, great. He's actually going it's- All right. So- Sort of like a private school kind of. It's called New Directions academy. One thing is, here in Dixon, about 25 years ago, there basically had been a huge lawsuit because there was illegal dumping, chemicals being dumped at the dump here and it got to the water table. And because of that, there were a lot of children that were born with the special needs. Oh wow. The whole Erin Brockovich thing, that's where it came from, was here. And because of that Dixon county in general has made a point to extend everything they can for special needs families and children to be able to go to school for as long as they need to. Wow. That's amazing that they- I moved to Springfield, Tennessee actually and after we had been dating for a while, and planning on getting married I actually moved him down here. Because we had so many problems with the school system that he was in, where I was at. And we found out all of the stuff that they provided here in Dixon county, for special needs kids. We just, we packed up and moved to Dixon. Wow. Well, it's really amazing that you all did that for him and that he has those services or that he has that support. Yeah. Because, when I divorced the dad, I was going to take Austin and moved back to south Mississippi because I have no blood family here. I'm from Biloxi. And after I met Matt and was doing a little bit of research about this area, because he was telling me that they had a really good support system here in the school system and in the community and everything for special needs children. And that's why I decided to stay was I met him and this area that he lived in had so much to offer for children with special needs and where I was from in south Mississippi, there was nothing. That's a really beautiful story. It's not every day that you hear that. So I'm really glad that Dixon has so many things available and that you were able to find those. And that actually brings me to the next survey or the next-\n",
            "finishJust confirming earlier that you said that he is still in high school and is expecting to graduate in May. Yeah. Okay. In May of 2022, which is so exciting, and so is he currently working? No. And this is just something that we ask of everybody, why is he not working at this time? I think he's interested in wanting to get a job, but after being in virtual learning and struggling so much academically, I just told him that he needed to focus on school, and then if he maintained good grades for a considerable amount of time to where we wouldn't be concerned about him graduating successfully, then we would talk about it. So it's more just keeping the focus on his education rather than working, but he does want to get a job. Of course. And so has he worked and left any jobs since the last time we spoke?  No.  And what about volunteering in the community? Nope. Okay. And so now we'll move on to talking about the goals that we set last year, and so  ...\n",
            "finishFirst I want to talk to you about, so as I understand it, you are about to start school, right? Yeah. I go on the 24th. Oh, that's so exciting, but you haven't started quite yet, so we can skip those questions. And now let's see, I'm wondering about your work at Kroger. So I know you just started, but so far how do you feel about this job? Do you think it's a good fit? Yeah, I feel okay with it. And what makes it a good fit? It's something simple to do. A lot of people were saying how bagging groceries can be a little complicated first, but honestly it's not as hard as they all said it would be. And I'm taking this opportunity since I work up front, I'm constantly having to speak to people, I'm taking this as an opportunity to improve my social skills. So that's definitely something I can gain from this. That's awesome. The people I work with are really nice. That's great. It sounds like you found a good opportunity. Yeah. So is there anything else that you'd like to say about working at Kroger so far? Any thought, that's fine. No, that's everything. Okay, great. So, that one is complete.\n",
            "finishYour mom was telling me that you were in  State Community College. Yes.  And so I just wanted to know, do you feel that this program has been a good fit for you? So far, yeah. And what makes it a good fit? Well, I made progress with certain life skills. I started making , and I've built up slightly more confidence in myself and independence than I had before. That's great. I'm really happy to hear that. And is there anything else that you would like to tell me about Motlow State before we move on? I think that's everything. Okay.\n",
            "finish...much for speaking with us today. We really appreciate your time. So what I'm going to do is, I'm just going to ask you a few questions about some activities you've been involved in. And then after that, we'll have a brief discussion about some goals you might be interested in working on. And of course, if you have any questions, or if you need to pause for any reason, feel free to let me know at any time. So first, your mom was telling me a bit yesterday about how you just started at the Humane Society volunteering. So I was just wanting to know if that's been a good fit for you so far? I mean, I only went there one day, but it was interesting. Mm-hmm . So do you think that it's so far been pretty good, or is it kind of too soon to tell? I guess it's been . Okay. And also what made it interesting starting there? I only really got a volunteer form because I guess my mom asked when she was dropping things off or something, and I figured, I mean, why not? Because I like them. We've gotten a lot of animals there, so we're familiar with them. Yeah. And so the next one that we want to ask about is working at McDonald's. Did you feel like that one was a good fit for you? No. And what made it not a good fit? I wouldn't consider myself mature, but I would consider a lot of the people that I was working with mature. Yeah. There's just like a lot of them not wanting to do their jobs and me doing stuff with their job and their tasks, and they didn't want to do that. Yeah, no one would, that's not fun. And what was your reason for leaving this job? They had gotten a new hiring per... A new person and they had been there like a month or whatever. She was a friend of someone who was working there, and she was just really annoying. And she spit spitballs at me. I'd be like the... Oh. Right? Gross. And I'd be the butt of jokes or whatever. And that's not a big deal, but it was just constantly. And I was getting in the way of me working. So I just figured, I'd go at the start of it and then I got sick and then they started giving me less hours, once I came back. And I was like, \"I mean, I don't really need to keep working here.\" Yeah, no, that does not sound fun at all. And is there anything else that you'd like to say about work that experience? Or any additional comments? No. It's McDonald's. There's not exactly high expectations. Yeah. And then we also wanted to confirm some dates, I think that you worked in certain places? Let's see. And, do you remember the month and year that you started at McDonald's? About March 2018. And do you remember about what time you left? January 2019. Oh, okay. And what about, your mom said you also babysat a bit in high school? I do you remember around the month and year that you started and stopped babysitting? No. I have no idea. No problem. Or like maybe in approximation? Like what year in high school you were? It must have been, I don't know... It could have been in 2018, but it feels like it was before that. And do you know about how many months you tried that? No. No. Because it was our neighbors would call me whenever they needed me to like babysit if they had a parent teacher thing or they... Yeah. So maybe not such like a regular thing. Yeah, it was just whenever they texted me. Okay. And so that one is complete and now we will...\n",
            "finishOkay. And so, we've talked about this a little bit, but just wanted to double check, so can you describe his high school situation? His high school situation? He's in 11th grade and doing better... Mm-hmm . I really don't know what else to say. No, that's okay. He rides the bus to school, rides the bus home... And... He's in the house, not technically by himself, at night because the lady that owns the house, Donna, she's there upstairs, his bedroom is in the basement. So there's two rooms in the basement and his room is one, my room is the other, but Donna, the lady that owns the house, she's upstairs. So he's pretty independent at night. Mm-hmm . And- Gets himself up for school in the morning. That's great. And did his high school plans, like graduation date and stuff, did those plans or track change since the last time we spoke? No, he's still on track to graduate. He still wants to do the same thing, making videos. I think what he's going to do is try to go to some AV school and learn how to do video production. That would be really cool. And earlier you mentioned that he would be graduating next year, so I'm assuming May of 2022? Yes. Okay. And earlier we discussed his employment situation and you said that he's not currently working and... No he's not. Just wanted to double check the reasons he's not currently working? I think a lot of it just has to do with convenience. He likes the idea of getting a job because he likes the idea of having his own money, but he isn't comfortable learning how to drive yet. Mm-hmm . So his options for employment are really limited to what's around our house because of my schedule, I'm not going to be able to take him to and from work. He applied for a job at Publix, which was within walking distance from our house but they just didn't have a position open, they needed somebody that was 18 to work in the deli or something, I guess you to be 18 to  turkey. Mm-hmm . Just availability right now since doesn't drive. Yeah. Yeah. And has he worked and left any jobs since we last spoke? No he's never worked. Okay. And what about volunteering in the community? No.  Get out of bed for dinner, no. I just wanted to, before we end, ask if there's anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share that we haven't already gone over? I would like to just say that the fact that we're participating in this study, I think, has made him more aware of the fact that it requires him to put in effort and work a little bit. So the things that we've tried to do as far as getting him to be independent with his hygiene and be able to cook himself meals and that kind of thing, I think he's definitely heading in the right direction and he has picked up on some of those. So it gives me hope that maybe the rest will come in time. Mm-hmm . The fact that the kid  I paid 500 for him to get a crown at 15. What kid needs a crown at 15? it's crazy. Well, that's great to hear that you're hopeful, we love hearing that. And I think that's all the questions.\n",
            "finishAnd is he receiving any sort of services currently through the school system? No. Okay, and he... just confirming, he did not exit the school system since the last time we spoke, he'd exited the school system before we last spoke in May of 2021? Correct. And so for this section, I'm going to ask you about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's attended since May of 2021, the last time we spoke. But first I'd like to get an idea of how he normally spends his time. So, what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? Mostly school. And so, he probably works on school for about six hours a day. Wow. And then he's not working. So then the rest of that time would be with family. He does have a friend that lives nearby, so they spend time together at church, twice a week. And then probably the rest of the time at home, playing a video game. Mm-hmm  and so you mentioned that he does... he works on school about six hours a day is that five days a week? Yes. Okay. So about 30 hours spent with school related activities. And so now I'd like to know more about his school program. What is the name of his school program? He goes to Motlow State Community College. And can you tell me a little bit about this program? It's a community college he's working on his general studies. So he'll finish his associate's degree in May And- And this semester has been online. Okay. The classes have been online And just confirming, this is not autism or disability specific program. It does not. Okay. And you mentioned that his area of study is general studies. Uh-huh . And what is the average number of classes that he takes per semester? Four. Four, and so I imagine that he is full-time Yes. Okay. And do you remember the month and year that he started at Motlow State Community College? August of 2020. And has he been receiving supports from the program? So he is registered with their disability and access center at Motlow and so they allow for extended test time. That's probably the biggest accommodation that he has made use of, he also gets extended time on assignments, but he hasn't had to use that. And he gets a note taker, but this semester, because it was online, he hasn't had to use the note taker. Mm-hmm  and do you feel that this program has been a good fit for him? I do. Mm-hmm  and what makes it a good fit? Well, this semester, the online that flexibility has been good. And I do think that their accommodations that they have offered for him have been successful. He could not have been successful without that extended testing time. So that's been really helpful That's great. Yes. So this one thing I forgot that probably relates back to the beginning and I'm so sorry. Oh, no problem. So transportation is our greatest barrier relief for everything. And so my dad, his grandfather has been transporting him for us to Motlow two days a week. So he could go to school for that first year, but he has since moved. So that's why this whole past semester was online and that's why next semester will be online also. Oh, okay. Thank you so much. That is very helpful to know. I think that's probably in the... for us in the Green Scheme of Life, that is a big change. Mm-hmm  so just confirming that his grandfather used to transport him to school, and now that he is no longer able to due to moving Clay will continue online. Yes. Okay, and has he been enrolled in any other academic program or school since the last time we spoke in May? No. And, so is he currently participating or has he participated in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke in May? He's had to do some volunteer hours for Tennessee Promise. So he's done those. And what did those look like? He actually came to work with me and volunteered at the Speech Clinic at MTSU. Oh, great. And- To lift the furniture because I needed some muscles. ... and, so how many hours a week was he doing that? He just had to do eight hours for this semester. Okay, and so now we will move on to talking about some goals-\n",
            "finishAnd so, is Lee still in high school? Oh, no, no, no. Sorry, because you just mentioned Ball State. And did Lee ever work during high school? No. And what about volunteering? No. She volunteers now, but not during high school. She didn't do any work. She did theater in school, so that was the only extracurricular thing she did. Mm-hmm . And what does a typical week look like for Lee? How has she been spending her time? Lately? YouTubeing on YouTube. That's it. She hides in her room. I work, so I don't pay attention to her. She hides in her room. She watches a lot of YouTube. She gets into a thing and she binges it and that's all she wants to do. Mm-hmm . And you mentioned that she is about to start at Ball State? Started a volunteer job yesterday. Oh, okay. And- Humane Society. Okay. And what about any educational programs? Not right now. Okay. And how many hours do you think she'll spend volunteering per week? I don't know yet, but so far, she worked yesterday, she took today day off, she's going back tomorrow. So, she's probably going to do about 20, maybe 20, maybe a little less. And so, has she been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college, or college, or university since high school? Well, she started to try and she started the process to go to Ball State, but then we went into the COVID lockdown, and so we have not finished. She doesn't want to go until they have campus open. She doesn't want to do online schooling. So I don't know if they're even doing that, though. I think Ball State might not be. I don't think they have the resources. Yeah. So I'll definitely make a note of that. Okay. And for the volunteering, you said that was the Humane Society. Does she receive any supports there? No. Okay. Any help or training? Okay. No, we go there all the time and they have volunteers there, they have high school kids do it for service credit. And just so Lee would have something to do, I said, \"Hey, do you need a volunteer?\" And the guy there is like, yeah. So I got an application. She filled it up, dropped it off on Saturday, started this Tuesday. So, they know her because she goes there with me all the time. So, he's using her to help him in the office. So he's going to train her to answer the phone for him, and she said do filing for him. So to do filing and to answer the phone. And so, found the job through sounds like having connections there? Yeah, walk-in. Yeah, we go there all the time. We've adopted three dogs. Wow. Okay. And you said about 20 hours and just started, you said yesterday? Yes. Oh, that's so exciting. Yes, I'm excited. Okay. And do you have any additional comments about the Humane Society and about volunteering there? I know she just started so there might not be a lot to say now. There really isn't, other than I'm just glad that they're going to show her few things. It's not just to pet the animals. They actually saw her as someone who could help in the office, because the guy there is a one-man show, he runs everything. Wow. So he could get someone to actually help. The high school kids come in, but they just pet the animals and walk them, but he's having her help in the office. He's like, yeah, I need somebody in here. So it's something that could develop into a job, hopefully- Yeah. ... down the road. Okay. And has she participated in any other employment, vocational, or volunteering activities since leaving high school before? She worked for McDonald's for about 10 months. You said McDonald's? Yeah. She worked at McDonald's full-time for about eight months. Eight, 10 months. I don't remember exactly. And what did she do there? She was a front counter. She did cashier, front counter, and drive-through. Mm-hmm . And how did she find this job? McDonald's job? Mm-hmm . I pushed her and she applied for a few jobs and they hired her right away. McDonald's doesn't turn anyone down. Yeah. And you said she was working about 40 hours a week? Close to 40. Just maybe a little short of 40 hours, but she was working full-time. And do you remember the month and year that she started? Not really. Mm-hmm . Or- She can tell you. If you ask her tomorrow, she'll tell you. Yeah, I'll make a note of that. Let's see. Okay. And do you remember the year? She started in 2018. 2018. So for now, as a placeholder, you said about eight months, so I'll put from January until September. She worked in 2019, so it was somewhere in the spring, I think she started there. Oh, okay. So maybe from March until January or something. Okay. Perfect. She'll know exactly. I don't remember exactly. Okay. Let's see. And what was her reason for leaving this job? She was unhappy. Mm-hmm . And so she quit because of that? Yeah. Well, there was some bullying going on. Some of the younger kids wanted to fight with her and she wasn't biting. She was like, no, because I want the job. But she got tired of it and she told the manager and said \"I might not come back.\" So she didn't up and quit. She finished her day. She had a day off. She's like, \"I don't know if I'll come back in two days.\" She told the manager what had happened, but Amy hadn't done anything about it. So she didn't go back. Yeah. And have there been any other jobs or volunteering that she's been involved in besides those? She's done some babysitting. That's about it. She's also done some tutoring, very, very little tutoring. She helped my friend with her younger daughter's math and she needed some help with math. And for the babysitting, was that outside of high school as well? That was when she was still in school. She would babysit next door. The neighbors had two kids and they liked going to a hockey game and Lee would babysit them when they went to a hockey game. Okay. So I'll write that down. Okay. And about how many hours would she do that? Two to four hours, maybe once a month. Okay. And do you remember around the months and years that she started and stopped doing that? That was probably 2000. We moved here in '16. It was probably '16 to '17, on and off, just the hockey season. They didn't really go out much. They worked hard. Those kids were demanding. I don't know how she did it because I would be like, nope, I'm not watching you little monsters. Yeah. And so can you tell me a little bit about that and what she did and what her responsibilities were? Yeah, to let the dog out for a little while. She had to get the kids to bed, make sure that they had their stuffed animals and feed them a snack before they went to bed. I guess they already gave them dinner, but they could have a snack and then put them to bed, because it was usually late evening and then that was it. And then just wait for the parents to get home, but they would get up a lot. So, it wasn't just that. It wasn't just put them to bed and that's it you're done. No, those kids would get up constantly, find reasons to get up, and she would have to put them back to bed and calm down. They were very high-strung kids. Yeah. And so, do you think that this was a good fit for her interest and skills? Honestly helped her. She learned from it. I told her everything's a learning experience. So, it wasn't a good fit if you didn't love children, but it was a learning opportunity and she could make a little money and take care of others for a change. So, she enjoyed part of it. Some parts of it she enjoyed. Mm-hmm . Okay, great. And so it sounds like those are all the activities that she's been involved in, in and out of high school? Yes. Okay, then I think that this one is complete.\n",
            "finishBut actually first I'd like to talk to you about work and school. And so I talked to your mom a little bit about Nashville State, and I was wondering, do you feel that this program has been a good fit for you? I feel like it has, although there have been struggles, but college comes with struggles. And what makes it a good fit do you think? I think it's the two year free because of the Tennessee Promise helps out a lot. And anything else that you especially like about that program or any reasons why you feel it's a good fit for you? I like being in class more than I do online. And is the there anything else that you'd like to let us know about school or any other circumstances you'd like to elaborate on? You're free to elaborate if you'd like. I don't think I have anything else. Okay. And then your mom was also telling me about your work at Kroger. And so do you feel like this has been a good fit? Yeah... It's a lot of stress. I feel like I don't do as well with a lot of people. I feel like I would be better in a smaller place. Or, not a smaller place per se, but a place with less people. And so it sounds like you have kind of mixed feelings about it. Would you lean towards more like, \"Yes, it is a good fit,\" or maybe \"No, not so much a good fit?\" At first, I started out like, \"Yeah, this could get me through college.\" And I think that's about it. It just gets me through college. So it's a good fit for now, but I don't think it would be a good fit for the long term. So a good fit for now, but not as much in the future necessarily. Yeah. And is there anything else that you'd like to let us know about your work at Kroger? Not really. Okay. That's it. And so-\n",
            "finishYou ever work during high school? No. Okay. And what about volunteering during high school? Just a second, please. Jordan, Liz was walking in. Listen, I'm on Zoom call right now. Yes. I'm sorry, Jordan. We're back. I'm back. Oh, no problem. And did she volunteer at all? She did not work in high school. I would say she did a little bit of volunteering. And what volunteering did she do? Let's see. In high school, she did some childcare at church on a volunteer basis. What other volunteering did you do? I worked in a soup kitchen. Soup kitchen. That kind of thing. Can't think of anything else right now. That's great. And what does a typical week look like now for her? How has she been spending her time? Why don't I answer that in the context of going to school, which she's going to start back up in about another week. Is that okay? That's perfect. Because right now, it's summer. So it's kind of a typical and wouldn't really matter, but she has a full academic load at Lipscomb University. So she would go up there and typically knows about COVID-19. But our hope is that she would be on campus. I drive her there and she would get there and be there most of the day. In between classes, she would either hang out with friends, do school work or projects. And at home, she would hang around the family, maybe doing some homework or just take it easy. She likes doing TikTok videos. She has a channel, or I think you call it followers on TikTok. And so she does cosplay. Right now, you asked about high school volunteering. Another thing she's done now volunteering is something is there's a group that has something to do with cosplay where they go to a hospital- Oh, that's so cool. As characters. So she might be Merida from the a Disney movie. Oh, Brave. And so she goes in a hospital or, they have another thing at the zoo where the national zoo has these days for kids with either disabilities, illness or sickness. So there's some of that. So I'm kind of backtracking there. She does some of that as well now, or that would be involved in. That's awesome. That's really unique. That's such a cool volunteering opportunity. She really does enjoy that. So between college and volunteering, how many hours a week do you think she spends in those activities? Between college and volunteering activities? I'd say probably 45 hours a week. And so now I'll ask a bit about her program at Lipscomb. Can you tell me a little bit about her program? You said that she's studying film production. It is. I think it's called film. I don't know if it's production or just film. Yes, it is a bachelor's degree in film and it would include really all parts of film. I know she had a class in screenwriting last semester, and she also with the equipment, she's done some short films as assignments. Oh, that's so fun. All parts of film. I don't know that she's gotten into finance such as the money side of it. But I don't remember seeing anything there, but it's really all parts of film. Okay. Let's see. And what is the average number of classes that she takes per semester? I'd say four or five. One of them is kind of a lab which is a hands-on thing. So four academic and maybe one that's kind of what you might call a lab. So five. And do you remember what year and month she started there? Yes. It's been stressed out because she took a year off at Lipscomb. And also she got her AA degree at Columbia State. So the first two years equivalent to two years of college or university was at Columbia State. Oh, and we can talk about that one after this one. That's really good to know too. All right. Then with Lipscomb, she would've started in the Fall of 2017. Okay. And is she receiving supports from the program? I'm not sure what you mean by support. Or accommodations. I know sometimes that they have accommodations for extended test taking. Yes. She does have a little bit. It hasn't been very significant, meaning it really hadn't done a lot to her because we haven't used it very much. But yes, she has some kind of accommodations having to do with ADHD, but yes. Okay. And what kind of accommodations does she have available to her? Well, for instance, receiving the handouts, notes in writing, PowerPoint slides or the teacher's notes in writing. There is the option to have a reader for tests with also extra time for tests. The opportunity to have a laptop open in a class for taking notes. I believe that's it. And she doesn't use all of that, but in fact it's hard to use any of it. But I believe those are the ones that are in place. Okay. And do you have any other additional comments about this program? I do not have comments, I have questions. Can I ask that now, Jordan? Yeah, of course. You can ask a question at any time. Okay. Jordan, let me understand if I could more about if this is being done through Vanderbilt? Yes. And what is Vanderbilt's involvement in this? In other words, why is Vanderbilt doing this? Is this part of a test or what is the connection to Vanderbilt? So our lab is a Vanderbilt lab. So my boss or the primary principal investigator is a professor at Vanderbilt. And she is interested in learning about the transition to adulthood. And so we've developed as we kind of discussed a bit in talking about the program and the consent form, she's developed with some other universities this program to help connect parents to resources and services to help with a transition to adulthood. And so we're testing to see how effective that program is. So one day it can be implemented all over the country. Okay. All right. Now, let me ask this. One of the things that I guess concerns, baffles me or confuses me is what kinds of this is helping us as parents understand this transition? Jordan, it's not like for instance, if someone were Blind or if someone could not hear- So this was a two year program. And can you tell me a little bit about the program such as the number of classes she took, what she studied or what type of degree she got? She got an associates degree, which was an AA or an Associate of Arts. There was a certificate or designation called commercial entertainment. And so the degree included what I would call typical first year college course. What do you call it? Core Required classes or whatever. General education? Yeah, general ed. There was British Lit, some math and some science biology. So it had the general ed but it also included Creating and being involved in some plays in the theater. There was some productions stuff there including making the sets. So it had a variety of things but it was a general ed. It was associate's degree. So she had to do some of those basic things such as history. All that stuff. And how many classes on average did she take per semester? She took a full load and I'm going to guess it was four or five. It was considered a full academic load. I think that's four or five. And do you remember the month and year she started the program? She would've started it in the fall. Let's see. I think she started actually in the winter. She graduated in 2013, so it would be January 2014. I believe that was right, Jordan. I think she took a little bit of time off and I think she started January 2014 and she would've finished in June 2016. Nope. Honestly, I don't remember. I could get those dates from Kathy. I just don't- Okay. That's okay. I'll speak to Becks next time, ask her about it and she can confirm. So I'll put for now that she finished June 2016, but I'll write a note to confirm that with her. Yes. And, and she left because she graduated, correct? Correct. And was she receiving supports or accommodations? Yes. Same kind of thing. Exactly the same. So I can give that to you again, or can you just say the same? Yeah, I can say the same. It was the same as Lipscomb. Because in fact, they transferred over from Columbia state. They took the same set over. So it is ADHD stuff, extended time and a reader if needed. I think she used it once or twice in four years. So reader, extended time, and written notes. I think that's the main. Yeah. And do you have any additional comments about this program? No, I think we covered it. Perfect. And was she involved in any other sort academic program after high school? No. And so now we'll switch gears a little bit and talk about some of the vocational activities she's been involved in. So what is the most recent job that she has had? Because I know you mentioned that she worked at Kroger. She worked at Kroger. She's only done I would say basic retail like that. So what was the most recent job that she had? Maybe I'm trying to think of another one. She worked in a gas station, but that was when she was off in Ohio. She had a couple retail jobs in Ohio and the most recent one here was with us which would've been Kroger. Retail. Okay. And can you describe what she did at Kroger? Yeah, she worked in the click list. Click like mouse clicks. And list, such as a list of things. Click list was where they pulled stock for orders. People were going online and ordering groceries and they had a team of people going out into the store and pulling the stock. Oh, okay. And did she receive any supports while working? No. Okay. And let's see. And how did she find this job? It's a neighborhood store. She just went into the neighborhood, went in and applied. I think she just went her own. That's awesome. We didn't talk about it. Yeah. And how many hours a week did she work there? One time she was not in school. She worked maybe 20 to 30. I'd say 25. Put 25. Okay. And do you remember the month and year she started working there? I think it would be in the summer of 2017. So three years ago. And do you remember the month and year that she left? I'm going to guess in summer of 2018. Okay. And what were her reasons for leaving? She moved out of the area. Okay. And do you have any additional comments about working at Kroger? No. Okay. And you said she had some other jobs as well. Do you remember the job that she had right before working at Kroger? I don't think she had anything before Kroger. I'm trying to think if she worked at another store but I don't think so. Oh, Chuck E. Cheese. Was that after Kroger or before? Okay. I'm sorry. Liz was reminding me Chuck E. Cheese. I forgot about that. She worked in Chuck E. Cheese. Was that before Kroger? Yes. Okay. And what did she do there? She worked in the restaurant. Oh, she said it. She calls it  hostess. Oh, hostess? Yes. And did she receive support while working? No. Okay. And how did she find that job? I think a friend told her about it. And do you remember how many hours per week she was working there? I'm going to guess 20. It was at most . And do you remember the month and year she started working there? Hold on, just let me tell on this phone. Just a second. Sorry. No problem. Hey, I'm still doing that survey. I mean, I'm still working with them. Okay. Let's see. I'm trying to think here. I would say it'd be in 2016 to 2017. Just in that range. And do you have an idea of the month? And if not, that's okay. I can ask her next time. I don't remember it. So I'll for now put January and then I'll confirm it with her. And that would've gone through maybe summer of 2017. So maybe about five to nine months. Something like that. Okay. So I'll say maybe fall of 2016 to summer of 2017. Yes. That sounds good. And I'll put a note to ask about the date. Okay. And what was her reason for leaving? Yeah, she got really frustrated. I'm trying to think if they let her go or if she quit. I think she probably quit. I believed she quit. She had exasperated it. It was an unpleasant work environment. And you mentioned that she had a few other retail jobs as well? Yes. And do you remember the places that she was working? What? Do you remember the names of the businesses where she was working? So those other retail jobs. I don't know the names of them. I think one of them was Pilot and one of them was some bookstore. I'll let you ask her about all that. I mean, and I don't know about the start and stop, or any of that. Okay. So I can ask her that next time. So you said Pilot and a bookstore. Okay. Okay. Yes. So I will ask her about those when I speak with her. Okay.\n",
            "finishJust confirming that she has been out of high school for quite some time. And for this section, I'm going to be asking about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that she's been involved in since June 17th, 2021. So the last time we spoke. But first I want to get an idea of what a typical week looks like for Elizabeth. What does a typical week look like for her and how has she been spending her time? She's living elsewhere. So I would say that our assessment of how she's spending her time is unlikely to be accurate because we don't know, but we only get word from her and she knows certain things we're not enthusiastic about and others we are. So she would have a tendency to say what we want to hear. So I'd say my opinions about this are highly suspect. But a typical week, I do know that she works at the zoo, I believe five days a week. She's off Monday and Tuesday. So today she's off and tomorrow she's off. And on those off days, I think she tends to just goof off in the house and spend enormous quantities of time on electronics, which is difficult for us to think about, because I think this is such a brain dead waste of time. Some of it is TikTok videos that she's doing. Some cosplay, or what she calls cosplay, and she does create some videos with Disney characters or comic book characters, that kind of thing. That has a creative element to it. That's good. But there's also a lot of enormous wasted time: video games or chatting with people all over the world and just doing things that just don't sound very productive to us. And you mentioned that she's working at the zoo. Is this independently or with support? Independently. And how many hours a week does she work at the zoo do you think? I think it's somewhere between 20 and 30. She was doing 40 and then she claimed stress or something. So they knocked her back. I think the stress thing is seriously doubtful as to whether it's really- I'm just like \"okay, it's hard, life's hard...\" Now we'll talk about school programs that she attended after high school. Is she currently enrolled or has she been enrolled in any academic program at a vocational school, community college, or college or university since the last time we spoke? Not since we spoke, no. She has an undergraduate degree that she got in December of 19. Oh, ignore that. No, it would be December of 20. Because she got her  bachelor's degree during Covid. So either in May or December, I can't remember right now. But nothing has happened since June. She's not involved in any educational experience right now. Now I'd like to ask a bit more about her job at the zoo. So she's working independently at the Nashville zoo. What does she do at the zoo? I believe it's mostly oddball, custodial and maintenance. Litter and helping with maintaining the landscaping. I would say custodial and maintenance. I know that she doesn't have supported employment, but does she receive any sort of supports while participating? No. And I imagine she is paid at this job? Yes. And how did she find this job? I believe Kathy was helping her. Kathy was helping, my wife was helping her look for jobs and she found post or maybe, I'm not sure, but I believe we encouraged her to go to the website and I think she found you on the website. And do you remember the month and year that she started this job? Not really, but I'm going to guess April of 21. I'm sorry, March. I say March of 21. Do you think it's been a good fit for her skills and interests? As an introductory job? Yes, I think it has. So I think up until now, it has been a good job to do something easy, break into the workplace. But I do think it's hopefully going to spur her want to change to something else, but for now it's good. I don't think it's long term. Is there anything else that you would like to tell us about the job or any circumstances that you would like to explain? You're free to elaborate. I would say on the job, my concern would be that she may have played the disability card, so to speak, a little much. That's my concern. I think she adds unnecessary drama. I think she probably has some accommodations there that in my opinion are unnecessary. That's my, opinion. It's hard to say. What kind of accommodations is she receiving? For instance her saying she's stressed. And she just goes and lies down. That kind of thing where she, during the job where she can't do certain things, she says \"oh, I can't do that it stresses me out so I'm just never going to do it\". Another version of that is working less than 40 hours a week. I think that's an accommodation that she probably honestly doesn't need, but I think she's overplayed that disability card. So you said reducing work hours and being able to go lie down when stressed as examples of accommodations? Yes. And so has she been participating in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke in June? I believe she has done some cosplay volunteer activities where they go visit kids. Oh, in the hospital? Yes. At hospitals and maybe at the zoo. They had some events at the zoo for special needs and she has on several occasions, helped out with those events. And that was one of the reasons she liked the idea of going the zoo because she'd been there as a volunteer, doing stuff. That's great. What does her volunteering activity look like with the cosplay? It would be dressing up and going and just encouraging kids. How many hours at a time, or how many hours a week was she doing that? Oh, I'd say three or four hours at a time. Maybe just once a month would be my guess. Was she paid? No. And do you think that this activity has been a good fit for her skills and interests? Yes, uh-huh  . And what has made it a good fit for her? She gets affirmation, she gets appreciated. She believes it's meaningful for the kids and I think it is. And do you have any additional comments about this activity? Not that one. There's one other one that she did do, and that is give blood. She has done that with me several times. And she did that in July, I think. So she was giving blood in July? I believe so. I believe I get it mixed up as to when we've gone, but she has done that in terms of volunteer, giving blood at the Red Cross. That's great. And has she worked or volunteered at any other establishment since the last time we spoke in June? I don't believe so. So now we'll move on to talking about some goals.\n",
            "finishWorked during high school? No. And what about volunteering? No. Okay.\n",
            "finishAnd so just to confirm, you said he's in college, so he is out of high school at this time. And you mentioned though that he graduated last year. I think we spoke with you after he graduated though. So his high school track hasn't changed since we last spoke. And you said he graduated in, was it May of 2020? Yes. Okay. And what kind of diploma did he receive? A regular high school diploma. I'm not sure.  Mm-hmm . And so for the rest of the interview  I'm not sure what different ones there are. Yeah, well, there are occupational diplomas or certificates of completion, but I imagine since he's in college especially, that he would've received the regular diploma. Yeah, it's a regular diploma. So for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's attended since July of 2020. So what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? A typical week is if it's not really a pattern to which two days he gets off per week, but he usually has each day. He doesn't work before one o'clock. So he has his school time from about eight to noon and then working in the afternoon/evening. And he is usually home by nine o'clock at the latest. And after he gets home, he has a shower, he just kind of relaxes and plays video games or listens to music. And so he is in a college program. And then at work, is he receiving support or is he working independently? He works independently. Great. And so how many hours a week do you think he is spending in class and working? Oh, gosh, I'd say four to five hours a day in school and about the same times five for work. Oh, wow. So that's like 10 hours a day total for five days a week or? Mm-hmm . Wow. That's so approximately 50 hours a week for both  Yeah. He stays pretty busy. That's awesome. Especially during a time like now, and I know a lot of people are going so crazy. Yeah. Yeah. He's, we've all been very blessed. Nobody was shorted any hours during the pandemic. That's wonderful. And so you mentioned he's currently in school. What is the name of his post-secondary school program? I'm sorry, you asking for the school or his major? The name of his school. He's at Nashville State Community College. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about this program? It's a two year math degree. So right now he's mostly doing his, you know, just primary courses like gen ed things. He's done a couple of math classes and few science, music, history, that type of thing. And I'm assuming that this is not an autism or disability specific program. It is not. And what is his area of study? Math? Math. And how many classes is he taking per semester? On average. Four. Four. So I imagine he is a full-time student. Yes. It's I believe anything over 12 hours, I believe. So yeah, he fits that because I believe they have to do be a full-time student to get the Tennessee Promise, I think. And do you remember the month and year that he started this program? I want to say August of last year. And is he receiving supports from the program? No, we're trying to get that fixed now that he has a formal diagnosis. Okay. So I think earlier you said that his teachers had kind of given him informal supports, but now you are seeking  Informal. Yeah. They just basically extended testing times for him if he asked for it. That's pretty much the extent of it. So extended test time. But now with the new diagnosis, you're pursuing more formal supports? Correct. Okay. And do you feel that this program has been a good fit for him? I do. That's great. And what makes it a good fit? Well, I think he, It's just enough hours, but not too many hours. The only problem so far that we've had is that like this semester, none of the classes were virtual. They were all online. Like I said, it's harder for, for him and he doesn't have that interaction. Mm-hmm . And do you have any additional comments about this program? Any what? Any additional comments about this program or this school? No. Okay. And has he been enrolled in any other program or school since July of 2020? No. I imagined not. That would, there would be very little time for that. But now we'll talk about his job. So you said that he is currently working and where is he working? He works at Kroger. Okay. And you mentioned that he does not have supports, so he is working independently. What does he do at Kroger? It's mostly bringing in carts from outside to the inside area and then some bagging and occasionally some stocking, but mostly the outdoor carts. Mm-hmm .And I imagine he's paid at this activity. He does. And how is he, how did he find this job? Well, we actually suggested it. Mm-hmm .And on average, how many hours a week participate at this job? I'd say just an average five hour shift and then five days a week, about 24, 25 hours a week, approximately. And do you remember the month and year he started this activity? I went to say June will be two years, I think. Oh, Oh, wow. That's great. So he started in June of 2019? Correct. And do you feel that this job has been a good fit for him? I'm sorry, repeat that. Do you think that this job has been a good fit for his skills and interests? I do. And he is, it's a good outlet for him to stay busy too. A good outlet. And what makes it a good fit for him? Well, first of all, before he could drive, it was within walking distance. He's very personable. So he likes being able to talk to customers and other employees. It gives him a sense of purpose and, it's good for him to have that sense of accomplishment that he can do a job well done. That's great. And do you have any additional comments about this job? No. And has he been in involved in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke last July? Repeat that. Has he participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke last July? Oh, no. Okay. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you'd like to share? Nope. Well, thank you so much for speaking with me.\n",
            "finishAnd so he is currently out of high school and did not exit high school since the last time we spoke, correct? Correct. And so now I'd like to get an idea of what a typical week looks like for him. So what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? So he has classes Monday through Thursday. So he has morning classes in person at Nashville State every day. And then, let me get this right. Mondays and Wednesdays he has a virtual class in the evening. Tuesdays and Thursdays he has an in-person class. So he just does school stuff Monday through Thursday. And then he works Friday, Saturday, Sunday. So he's pretty busy. Wow. And then on Mondays through Thursdays, the middle portion of the day between those classes, he utilizes that for working on school assignments or studying, but he does allow himself some leisure time to play video games or, especially in the evenings, he has a group of friends from high school that they all play at the same time. And so they talk through stuff. That's great. Yeah. And so how many total hours during the average week, and this can include time in class, time working on class assignments and time working at his job. How many total hours during the average week does he spend participating in all of these vocational and educational activities? Oh gosh. It sounds like a lot. Yeah. So, I mean, if I had to just guess, usually his ships at work are between six and eight hours. So we'll say seven hours, seven times three. So about 21 hours a week at work, approximately. And then Monday through Thursday, I would say probably eight hours a day. Let me think. So eight times four is 32. 32 hours for school. Wow. That's a really busy week. Yes. Yeah. That's impressive. Yeah. And then that's why I wouldn't want him to really- The pressure did not really show up until calculus. And so I really wish- he's feeling discouraged about choosing a math degree. Statistics is really the thing he wanted to do, but I've tried to explain this to him that calculus is just a requirement. It's not like you're going to have to do this for a job if you used a math degree for statistics, but it's just a requirement for school, you know? Yeah. I'm a nurse. I went to nursing school I learned all about OB GYN stuff, but I was an ICU nurse. So I didn't really use that, but I had to take it anyway, you know, it was just required. So, you know. And so now I'd like to learn more about his school. And so you mentioned he was at Nashville State. Can you tell me a little bit about the program and what he does there? So it's a two year math degree. It's associates program. He is full-time enrolled. We go just over the hour requirements. We don't want to stress him out too much. So this semester he's taking biology, sociology, American history, and calculus, and he really actually is enjoying sociology a lot. That's great. Yeah. He's really talked a lot about that. He's talked about that probably more than anything, except for when he is talking about being stressed out by calculus. He really enjoys the sociology. That's awesome. And- I can't recall what else he has left to take, but it's been, this is his second year in the program, so... Oh, that's exciting. So he's almost done. Hopefully with calculus. And I imagine this is not an autism or disability specific program based on what you've said. No. And he's taking about four classes per semester? Mm-hmm  And so do you remember, you said he is in his second year. Do you remember the month and year he started this program? He started... Okay. So he graduated high school, May, 2020 was graduation. So he started August, 2020. And we spoke about this a little bit, but wanted to kind of learn more about it. Is he receiving supports from the program? No, because we haven't been able to officially get him accommodations through the school because we're still waiting on that paperwork from the place from Athena Health. However, he has, at the beginning of each semester, sort of emailed his professors and explained that we're in the process of applying for those accommodations and that when he was in high school, he was given a lengthier test taking time. And that a lot of them have been receptive to that and sort of adjusted that for him on their own. Mm-hmm  Well, that's great that he's reached out to professors kind of individually and taken that upon himself to get that on his own. Yeah. We've been working on that. And a lot of times, if it's a phone call, well, if it's a phone call, I'm in the room, as you know, he forgets what to say. I just kind of whisper it to him, but he's doing the emailing and stuff, that's all on his own time. That's great. And do you feel that this program has been a good fit for him? I think it has. And I'm really glad that it's back in person because he learns much better in person than just virtually expecting them to pace themselves. Mm-hmm  And what makes it a good fit? I think because it's a smaller school, it's easier for him to transition from high school to community college than it would be to a four year university with a large campus. And I think that having started out virtually, while it might have been harder for him to learn, it at least got him used to the process of, it's a different level of expectation with college versus what they expected from you in high school. Mm-hmm . So I think it's been good. And has he been enrolled in any other academic program since the last time we spoke? No. Okay and so now I'd like to learn more about his job. And so where is he working? He works at Kroger. And does he work independently or does he have supported employment? Independently. And what does he do at Kroger? I can't remember what his job title is. It's some kind of customer clerk or front end clerk. I can't remember, but mostly it's cart returns, grocery cart returns. He's done some stocking and bagging groceries too, but it's mostly the carts. Okay. And does he receive so any supports while working? No. And I imagine he is paid at this activity. Yes. And how did he find this job? We actually encouraged him to apply there because at the time he wasn't driving and it's within walking distance of our house. So I can't remember- The first time he applied, I don't think he ever heard back from anything. And he had, I'm trying to remember how that worked, but when he applied the second time he got an interview and I think June was two years. He's been there now. And you said he works about 21 hours per week? About, yeah. And what month and year did he start? June 2019. Great. And do you think it's been a good fit for his skills and interests? I do. And what's made it a good fit? That it's close to home. It's given him a level of responsibility and frequently when he's working he texts us before he comes home. \"Do you guys need anything?\" You know, he'll pick up a few groceries for us and that's been really helpful. And it makes him, you know, really a fully productive member of the family as far as in an adult role. And so I think that's been good for him. He loves to be helpful. Once a week he buys the whole family dinner. Aw. That's awesome. Yeah. And do you have any additional comments about this job or any other circumstances to elaborate on? I think the only thing, and this is something that I think would be helpful for him to talk to a therapist about is, for some reason, he is bothered when people thank him at work, like customers, when they thank him, it bothers him because he feels like he's not really doing that much. \"So why would they thank me?\" And I think, well, they're just trying to be nice. You know, they're just trying to be nice. But I think that's something that, you know, I can't help him with that. I think that would be a, you know, mental health, professional therapist to coach him through understanding those kind of things. It's a disconnect with autism and Asperger. Definitely. And has he participated in any other employment activity since the last time we spoke? No. Yeah. It sounds like he's been pretty busy as it is. Yeah. He's got a full plate for sure. And so now we move.\n",
            "finishI wanted to confirm that Anna is still in high school. Yes. Did her high school plans or track change since the last time we spoke? No. When is Anna planning on exiting the school system? Well, I plan on keeping her in. I don't know if she'll go all the way to 22. But, if she starts to work and get a job and can be successful. I have a student that works four hours a day and then comes back to school. That maybe something she does where she works half the day and then comes back to school and spends the rest of her day... So, it might look different, if she's going to graduate next year with her cohort. Meaning she's going to walk with her peers at graduation. But, I don't plan on asking them to actually issue her a diploma until she's done. When would you estimate that she is planning on getting the diploma or like exiting the school system? Let's go ahead and say 22? 22? Yeah. On her 22nd birthday, I guess is what I'm saying. Okay and what month and year would that be? Let's see... It would be October 20, 2024. October 2024. Okay, and you earlier you mentioned that Anna is not currently working and this is just something that we ask to everybody. But, why is she not currently working? We just haven't gotten there yet. Yeah, of course. Has she worked and left any jobs since we last spoke? Just confirming that she hasn't, and then has she volunteered in the community since the last time we spoke? Uh-uh. Okay. Well great. Thank you so much for speaking with me today. We really appreciate it and this wouldn't be possible without your participation. So thank you so much. You're Welcome.\n",
            "finishJust confirming that she is still in high school. And earlier you mentioned that she is not currently working, and this is just something that we ask of everyone. So why is she not currently working? Well, she's pretty developmentally delayed. And so I think whatever job that she could do would be, I don't even think ... Well, again, you don't want me to refer to anything that you guys are involved in. But I've talked to other parents who have kids that are similarly affected, as affected as my daughter is. And they've told me things like, \"Well, that kid didn't really work out. They tried some different jobs, but the kid wasn't interested and couldn't do them. And so the kid is at home playing video games all day.\" And I don't want that for my kid. And so that's why I'm working on this Northern Hills transfer training center. So she has at least a place to go during the day to make her life a little bigger. And so I don't know if that's really answering your question. If you're saying, why isn't she working, she's not working because she's not capable. And thank you so much for explaining. And it sounds like the Northern Hills Health Training Center is going to be a wonderful opportunity. Well, I hope it is. I hope it is. If she can keep her fits and tantrums under control enough, and if they're willing to keep her on the Zyprexa, then I think she can manage it, and she can have a routine going on. But yeah, that's where we are. Our worst fear is that we build a house and move up there, and then they tell us her fits are too strong and they can't keep her at this place. That would not be great, but I don't think that'll happen. And just confirming that she has not worked and left any jobs since the last time we spoke. But what about volunteering in the community since the last time we spoke? Has she done that? No. Okay. And so now we'll move on to talking about some goals that we set last year.\n",
            "finishSo I'll ask some questions about his school and work, and I think this should be pretty short since he's still in high school. And so can you give me kind of a brief description of his high school situation? So is he still in high school or receiving services through the school system? He is still in high school. He still has another year. He's a junior. He does special education classes. He also does general session classes as well. So he is got a half and half kind of day. Okay. Okay. And did his high school track or plans change since we last spoke with you? No. Okay. And what month and year is he planning to exit high school? May of 2022. Okay. And is he currently working? No. Okay. And can you tell me kind of why he's not currently working? We haven't been able to find him something that... I don't know. Dalton is physically able to do anything, but his social skills lack. So we haven't done it one, because of COVID. When COVID hit last year, that kind of put that to an end because things were closing and whatnot. Then the school year started and we just... And then I thought about... I was going to go through the VR services through the school to get him in that kind of training and get him started and then that wasn't available due to COVID. So that's where we're at. Because of the COVID, we have not been able to get him excelled that far. Right. Okay. The door shut down on us. Yeah. Sorry about that. It's kind of taken its toll on everybody, I think. Yeah. Okay. So he hasn't worked and left any jobs since we last spoke to you in July of 2020? No. Okay. And has he done any volunteering in a community during high school since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. Sorry, one second. So is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you want to share about Dalton or your family or anything that we didn't go over that you'd like to discuss? No, I can't think of anything. Okay. And so I just want to verify. Is your current email and mailing address the same that we had before? Yes. Okay. Okay. Well, that's all the questions that I have. Thank you-\n",
            "finishAnd just confirming she is out of high school and has been out of high school since we last spoke as well. Yeah. Okay. And so for this section, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that she has attended since June of 2021, which was the last time we spoke. But first, I'd like to get an idea of how she spends her time in a typical week. So what does a typical week look like for her and how has she been spending her time? Yeah, she spends most of her time at home. There just aren't very many activities that she's interested in and are appropriate for her, so actually been a struggle. She's at home most days. She spends her time crafting. She spends her time ... Sorry, I couldn't quite hear the last part. Crafting. Oh, crafting. That's great. Okay, and so is she currently enrolled or has she been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college, college or university since June? No. Okay. And is she currently participating in any employment, vocational, or volunteering activities or has she been participating since June? No. Okay. And so now we'll move on to talking about the goals that we set last year.\n",
            "finishOkay. He's currently in high school? Yes. And has he ever worked during high school? No, he has not. And what about volunteering? No. Well, that's the end of that...\n",
            "finish... Things that she's done during high school. So let me open that up here. And she's still in high school, correct? Yeah. Has she ever worked during high school and can you... Well, you told me- Just those two weeks. Yeah. Yes. So from those two, which one was longest if you remember, or if they- Well, the train thing was longer, but the two-week period was actually more hours total. Okay. Okay. Maybe let's talk about the two-week period instead her hours total. Okay. And that wasn't part of school programming, right? Right. No, that was not. Was she getting paid for that one? The  thing? Yes, she did get paid. And what was the name of the company, or organization that she was working at? It's called Apparel Embroidery. And how did she... You said she found the job because of her dad? Yeah. Okay. And they needed extra help for two weeks? Yeah. A busy season. Yeah. Yes. So how many hours a week was she working there? I think she worked almost... She worked a little over 50 hours total. Wow. Yeah. Do you remember approximately the month when that happened? I think it was December. Last December? Yeah. And that lasted for around two weeks? Yeah. And can you tell me a little bit about what she was doing? Her duties and how she was spending her time at that work? Yeah. So they do a lot of embroidery pieces and she would trim the tiny threads on the back. The finishing work basically. And did she receive any supports while working there? No. But the job was modified. If they hired someone from the street, they would be expected to do a lot more. And do you think this was a good fit for Jordan's skills and interests? She's really good with fine motor small tasks. So it fit her in that manner. She did really like working. The room was all ladies and she enjoyed that part, having coworkers. But otherwise, I would say, \"No, it's not a disability-friendly environment.\" They didn't have any capacity to further modify or accommodate her. And then the other job that she had, was that December? Was that the Christmas season last year? Actually, it was three years ago. So 2016. That was 2016. And she was an . Do you remember the name of the place where she was working? It's called... The name just left my brain. Well, it's fine if you don't remember. It's a historic railroad thing. I have to think of it. Yeah. Okay. Something like that. And is that in Nashville? It's here in Chattanooga. Okay. Sorry. I think I wasn't aware that you were a . Yeah. I'm the one down here. I work in Nashville a lot. Yes. I remember John told me about it. But that wasn't in my head today. And how many hours a week was she approximately? So that was on Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Maybe four a week for maybe five weeks. So maybe 20 altogether. Yes. And what was she doing? I mean, was it mostly being in  and- Yeah. Basically, the train pulls up. It's a historic thing. So they do this thing on a platform where the train spins around to go the other direction. So while it does that... They have the area decorated, like the North Pole. So they would have actors come out and do a little skit thing, so it's not boring. And she was paid for that. Yeah. Did she receive any supports while her doing that job? From me. Yeah. So informal supports from you, but not from the employer? Correct. And what was that? Being there with her, or what? Yeah, I was there. Okay, great. And then did... Or does Jordan volunteer in the community now or during high school at any point? Yeah. She volunteered. We're not doing it now. We stopped when she broke her wrist last summer and we just never picked it up after that. And then COVID happened. But she was volunteering at... The Humane Society has a thrift store down the road from where we live. And she liked that. So we worked in the sorting room where people drop off their donations and they're prepared to go out to the thrift store floor. So really her kind of thing, looking through stuff in a box. She enjoyed that a lot. It was not a modified environment. I also volunteered so that I could be with her. And she did become overwhelmed by it. She really was only comfortable with getting the sellable items out of the things that were donated. Figuring out where they went on the floor was a little too difficult for her. And how-  were talking to her out there too. What did you ask? Sorry. How often were you guys doing that? Was that once a week? She was doing that once a week. Yeah. For three hours. We did that for about a year. Okay. So that's the last question for this one. And next, I think Jordan is going to ask about services. So I'll stay here, but just mute myself. Thank you, Sarah. Sure.\n",
            "finishSo is he currently working? No. And this is just something that we ask of all participants. Why is he not currently working at this time? A few reasons. He's 17. He cannot work by himself. He'll always need support even at work. I mean, the number one reason, he's still in high school, and he can't drive. He'll never be able to drive. Like I said, he cannot work at a job independently without someone around him, even when he's an adult. And so assuming that he has not worked and left jobs since the last time we spoke, what about volunteering experience since the last time we spoke? I can't think of anything that he has done. Okay. And so now we'll move on to talking-\n",
            "finishOkay. And so just confirming he is still in school? Yes. And is he currently working? No. And this is just something that we ask of all families. Why is he not currently working? He's not currently... Attention span is a little short, but I don't know. We haven't pushed it. I want him to focus on going to school and getting his... Getting through school. Instead of having to worry about a job on top of school too. So, but he has no... He doesn't really have any needs for of anything, and whatever he needs we can provide. Great. And just confirming that he has not worked and left any jobs since the last time we spoke in May? No. Okay. And what about volunteering in the community since the last time we spoke? He has not volunteer, but he'll volunteer around the neighborhood to help anybody cut their yard, rake their leaves, whatever. That's wonderful. Yeah. Okay. One moment, then we'll continue to the next set of questions. Sure. Did you clean your glasses today? I did. I thought you did. They just looked like they had spots on them or something. . No. No. No. . .\n",

And some of these we've also already touched on, but just asking to double check, is she currently working? No. And this is just something that we ask of everyone, why is she- Okay. ... not currently working? Well, she goes to school full-time and she also doesn't seem to want to do that. Also, she doesn't drive a car, so it would be hard for me to always be available at those times to take her somewhere. But she doesn't show any interest right now and wanting to work anywhere. Mm-hmm . Okay. It would probably be  with her, depending on the job, but she could get overstimulated easily, so I'm not totally sure how well that would go. Mm-hmm , of course. And has she worked and left any jobs since the last time I spoke with you in June? No. And what about volunteering in the community since the last time we spoke? No, she hasn't done any volunteering. Okay. And so now I'll move on to talking about some goals.\n",
            "finishWe'll talk about some activities that he may be involved in. So earlier, you've kind of mentioned this, but I just wanted to confirm, can you describe his high school situation? He's in high school and they're virtual. And did his plans or track change for graduation plans since the last time we spoke? No. No? And when is he planning on exiting high school? Next year. So 2022. Would that be May? Yes. And is he... You mentioned he's not currently working? No. And why is he not working at this time? I mean, I don't see why... He's not an adult yet. I don't know why he would be working. Yeah, exactly. I just have to ask. Okay, , I did when I was his age and younger, but he's just not in a situation where... You know, he's still a kid. Yeah, exactly. I mean, he's got a lot of other things on his plate right now, I imagine, with school. Yeah. Not to mention, I wouldn't wanted, I mean, we're still in all of this, so even if I wanted him to get some job experience, I would be hesitant. The only job he's ever had was he was a counselor in training at a summer camp one year. Oh, that's that sounds like a fun job. Mm-hmm . So it sounds like just to confirm he has not left any job since the last time we spoke? Yeah. And what about volunteering in the community since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. So it looks like that was actually the end of that one. And I just wanted to ask before ending this call though, is there anything else that you would like to share with us or any other updates? No, I guess the only comment that I make is there is a lack of awareness and resource for people like my son. Like on his bedroom or other issues, or opportunities to earn money online. So that's kind of where I'm leaning for him to understand: how to learn Facebook ads, how to learn Instagram or Google ads, how to do affiliate marketing or all kinds of different ways to monetize things online. And so I've just been kind of disappointed with the lack of awareness of those opportunities and even the lack of resources and ways to learn about that. Yeah. That would be a really wonderful opportunity for a lot of people and definitely very needed at a time like this. Agreed. Well, thank you.\n",
            "finishConfirming that she is not currently still in high school or receiving services through the school system? Correct. And did she exit the school system? So her transition program since the last time we spoke, I believe the summer of 2020. So yeah, she went through from school that ended. Okay. And when did she withdraw? It had to be February 2020. Oh, okay. February 2020. So looks like, I think we must have spoken a bit after. Okay. And so now I'm going to ask about some academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that she's been involved with since the last time we spoke in 2020 in the summer, but first I'd like to get an idea of how she normally spends her time. So what does a typical week look like for her and how has she been spending her time? We are at home for the majority of time. Occasionally, we'll do the family, we'll go to the store, but for the most part we are at home. Okay. And, And so I know that we've gone over this just a little bit, but just confirming. Is she currently enrolled or has she been enrolled in any sort of academic program at a vocational school, community college, or college or university since the summer of 2020? No. And what about any employment or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And now we'll switch gears a bit and we'll talk about some goals that-\n",
            "finishAnd so you mentioned earlier that he is still in high school. Could you describe briefly his high school situation? Yeah. So he goes normal high school hours Monday through Friday, 8:00 to 3:00. He is in a CDC or life skills class. They have like 10 kids in it. They do a lot of job training, life skills, learning activities, and then they go to work for approximately an hour and a half a day, four days a week. An hour and a half a day, four days a week. That's great. And so has his high school track or plans changed since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And when is he planning on exiting high school? May of next year. That's so exciting. And is he currently working? No. And what are the reasons that he's not currently working? Just because he's in school all day and it's... Yeah, we do plan for him to look for employment and find out what he wants to do, but probably after he gets out of school. I feel like he needs more training in that area first. Of course. And has he worked and left any jobs since the last time we spoke last July? No. And what about volunteering in the community during high school since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share with us today? No, I think I'm good. Okay. Great. Well-\n",
            "finishSo I will share my screen. Okay, can you all see my screen? Yes. Okay. So Lydia, we're going to talk about some things to do, some goals, and you'll pick your top three, your favorite three. So the first one is the animal shelter, so working with cats and dogs is that- There's the caregiver. Open the door quick. Lydia, hurry up. Funny how that happened right on cue. That's okay, this should only take about five minutes at the most. Go open the door, let her in. Now come back, come on back. Come on in.  We're wrapping up a poll with Vanderbilt, with a research program. Lydia come here, this is your turn. Oh no, I can't hear you. Oh, there it is. I put my hand, I moved my hand again. Okay. So Lydia Juan is working at the animal shelter, so with cats and dogs. Is that thumbs up, thumbs in the middle, or thumbs down? Do you want to work with cats and dogs? Yes or no? Yes. Yes. Yes? She said yes. She'll usually say the last one. Oh. So I'm pretty sure that was... Awesome. So I'll go ahead and put that as her top three. So the next one, this is going to bit harder to explain, but this is a meeting all about you. So talking about what you want to do, Lydia. So does that sound good, or so-so, or bad? A meeting all about what you want to do? She did thumbs down. That's okay, I probably would do the same. Okay so I'll just delete this one. And the next one is a chore chart, so working on things around the house, like sweeping, and mopping, and cleaning. Is that thumbs up, thumbs in the middle, or thumbs down. Do you want to follow it? Oh she's done thumbs up. Awesome. I don't know if you can see it or not, but she actually did it. Great. Pay attention, this is for you. Thank you so much, Lydia. And the next one is working on crossing the street, so looking both ways when you cross the street. Thumbs up- Pay attention, she's asking you. Thumbs in the middle, or thumbs down? For crossing the street and looking both ways. Do you want to learn to cross the street safely? Yes or no? Yes. She said yeah, well she said yes and did thumbs down. So go with a maybe on that. Yeah, yes, but thumbs down. Lydia, this is for you. This is about you. I'll put that as neutral. You're going to go in a minute. And then the last one, Lydia this is asking nicely before going to the pool, opening the fridge, and going in the car. Is this one thumbs up, thumbs in the middle, or thumbs down? Do you think you can ask nicely before going to the pool? Yes. That's a thumbs up. Thumbs up. She's getting restless. Okay, well she's all done. I think we you've got our three. And so I will send those to you later Chris, by email. Okay that's good. Perfect. Thank you so much Lydia, you are all done. She is ready to go now because that's what.\n",
            "finishOkay. And so, just confirming, he is still in high school? Yes. And is he currently working? No. And this is just something that we ask of all participants. Why is he not currently working? He's not 18. That definitely makes a lot of sense. Yeah. And I imagine then that he has not worked and left any jobs since the last time we spoke. What about volunteering in the community during high school since the last time we spoke? Not since the last time we spoke, just for safety issues. Okay. Well, I take that back. He did do one volunteer activity with his friend, Tom. I think they painted a horse fence or something. Painted a fence? Okay. One moment. And then I'll continue to the next one.\n",
            "finishGreat. So that's the last question for this one. Now for the next part I'm going to stay here, but mute myself and then Jordan will be asking you some questions and , and please, if you need a break or if you need to just walk for a couple minutes, we are flexible. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see. So now I'm just going to talk about some activities that Elise has been involved in. And is she currently in high school? Is she still in high school? She graduated high school. She's in the Transitions Program. Okay, and did she ever work during high school or the Transitions Program? She worked in the school with the Transitions Program. And how many jobs has she held through the Transitions Program? In school, one that I'm aware of. And did she receive payment? Pop-Tarts. That's not bad. So what was this job that she held? In the student lunchroom, she would fill up the milk box and the juice. Where they had the soda and the large juice, she would fill that container up. Okay, and how many hours a week did she work? Five. And do you remember when she began working this job? Her senior year of high school. You need a year? You still need the year. Would that be August 2018? Closer to October, November. October, November? And is 20-  2018 the correct year? Yes. Okay. And I know that she's probably not been around there since shutdown happened, but is she currently still enrolled in the Transitions Program? She is. Do you think that she'll continue working in the lunchroom once things have settled down? Well, now they're going out into the community to see about finding what her fit would be working outside. That's awesome. And do you remember when she stopped working in the lunchroom? 2019 and the Transition, she didn't go back to that. They went to something else. So just that last year of school. Would that have been June 2019? May. Or May? Okay. And so you said that she would fill up juice, correct? Yeah. The drinks, the drink. And what else did she do? That was her job. Okay. And did she receive support while she was working? She did, she received some in school. Yeah. From like teachers, or? The ladies in the cafeteria. And do you think that this was a good fit for her? I do. And what made it a good fit? It wasn't overly complicated, and when she was done, she knew she was done. And did she volunteer at all in the community during high school? No ma'am. Okay. So that one was a short one. And now we'll move on to talking about some goals, and so it looks like... How many do we have? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... So we need to narrow down the goals to five goals. You selected some really good ones, but unfortunately, we're only able to talk about five. And so what we'll do is I'll share my screen and show the goals to you, and if you select your top five... And these can be goals... If you have a hard time selecting, maybe think about what goals do you think would be her favorite or what goals are more immediate, like you'd like to work on within this year. And then, we will talk about each one of those five really in-depth, then we'll customize them to meet Elise's unique needs. I'll share my screen. Okay. Are you able to see the goals? Yes. Okay, great. So, we have got youth will independently initiate conversations with peers. We've got a goal about making a list of activities she would want to do with a peer. We have one about applying for community integration services through the Medicaid waiver. We've got one about a-\n",
            "finishOkay. And what does the work-based learning entail? Generally? They as of the last two years, they go for about two, I think it's two hours a day, four days a week to different.... He has two different jobs. He goes two days to one job and two days to another job. Okay. So two jobs and both through school, does he receive payment at either of those jobs? No. And where are those jobs? One was at Longhorn Steakhouse. We did like did silverware and clean the tables and stuff. And the other one was at our well it's actually our church, but the First Baptist Church. He cleans up after the Sunday services. He'll clean up Monday morning, clean up the sanctuary and get the tables and stuff ready for their Wednesday night meal. You know? So depending on what day he's there. Oh, that's so nice. And which one has he been doing for the longest? They do them per year. So he's done that... Those were his two jobs this past school year. The school year before that he was at two different restaurants; or one was like a fast food restaurant kind of situation. But they do them for the course of the year, as long as there's no issues. Okay. So Longhorn Steakhouse, the church and then another restaurant. So he's had a total of three? Well, he's done work-based learning for the last, I'd say probably four years. Oh, wow. Yeah. So, I think when you become a junior in high school, in the life skills program, you start doing the work-based learning. So he's actually had multiple different places that he worked at just during that hour or two at school. But every year it's usually two different assignments per year. Yeah. And you said it's generally about two hours at a time, four days per week? Now it is. Once you graduate... So before you graduate, it's just two days a week, but once you graduate from high school, which he did two years ago, they bumped it up to four days a week. So they're trying to get him out there more. And do you remember when he started working at Longhorn Steakhouse and the church? That would've been back in August. Well, probably September when, after school started, usually about a month after school starts they start. So I'd say probably September to this March, when we got sent home from school. Yeah. So I was going to ask if he currently works at those jobs, but I know that COVID has made that really hard. Yeah. So I'll add a note about that. Did that stop around March? Mm-hmm . And he wants to work. He wants a job. I just want him to have more training and skills before we actually get a job, because I don't think he's ready. I think he's ready to work, I just don't think he's ready with the job skills and the interpersonal skills that he needs to hold a job. And I don't want a situation to arise, you know? So I told him once he finishes school, we'll definitely look into getting him a job somewhere. But I think he just needs more education. Yeah. And the job that he worked last year is as part of work-based learning, he was also doing that for about eight hours a week? Mm-hmm . What job was he working last year? And did he work for the whole school year? Last year he did. He did... I know one of them was Pie Five. I want to say he did the church last year too. I think it was Pie Five and the church again last year, but he did do it the whole year. Okay. And what kind of responsibilities does he have at the church? You said he would clean up and set up for services? He does the sanctuary on Mondays and then on Wednesdays they have the Wednesday night meal. So he would prepare the tables and make sure there was salt and pepper and that kind of thing. Okay. And did he receive, or does he receive support while working? They have a job... One of their aides from the classroom is usually with them or peer buddies that are in the classroom. So yeah, there's always somebody there with him. They don't usually have to help him perform his duties, but they're there in case they need help or anything. Mm-hmm . And do you think that working at the church has been a good fit for him? Oh yes. He loves it. Oh, that's awesome. So what does he love about it? Just that he knows people, because we've been going to church there for a while, so he knows people, he gets to see them and I think he just feels a part of it. He just likes being a part of it. Mm-hmm . I'll write that down. And has he volunteered at all in the community during high school? I don't think so. Yeah. It sounds like he's already really busy. He's got a lot on his plate. Yes, he keeps us on our toes.\n",
            "finishI'd love to know more about your job. So I know you're currently at, I think, Amazing Lap studios, what you said. So do you feel that this job is a good fit for you? Absolutely 100%. I love my job. I love the pay. I love my coworkers. We're like a sisterhood. We don't have any drama. We get along very well and we have each other's back and they help us. That's great. So you said there's no drama and people help each other out. Oh yeah. I feel very safe. This is like the first job I feel safe. Both in physicality, like nobody's going to hit me or throw trash, or nobody's ever going to disrespect me. And also I trust to leave my stuff. I'm always a paranoid person. I'm always making sure nobody steals my phone or steals my stuff so I can leave my purse out and nobody would touch it. But I'm still kind of paranoid so I still put my stuff away, but everybody got my back. I got theirs if they need any help. That's great. I'm so glad to hear that. And- Yeah, I love this job. And is there anything else that you like to say about this job before we move on to the next one? Nope, I'm all good. Okay. And so the next one was, I know that you worked at Sun's Up is what your mom was telling me. And so what was your reason for leaving Sun's Up? I got really frustrated because I was not getting any clients and it was just frustrating. I was not getting any money. I lost money from them than gaining money. So that's it. And also the environment, it's in Greenbriar. Greenbriar's a nice place, but it's more I am looking forward to where the money is, and that is like West Nashville or International Brentwood, Mount Juliet, Cool Springs, the hot places, hot spa places. Greenbriar is too country, or a lot of people are older and they see lashes more of the luxury than a necessity. Okay. And so, it was great to hear about your work experiences. I'm really glad to hear that it's such a great fit where you are now.\n",
            "finishNot independently. Okay. So if thing he would've done, I would've been there. But so he's still in high school and he's never worked during high school, but he did want to? Even with you or with others, what type of volunteering was he or is he involved in? He has volunteer hours that he has to do through several of the clubs and organizations that he belongs to. So they've done some packing Second Harvest Food Bank bags, that kind of stuff. Most of the ball volunteer work that he's done, he's gotten his volunteer hours through school. So, because I worked there, so in the hours where the school, like the weeks where the school's closed, he'll come up and help with filing. He will help in the library, those kinds of things. And is that something that happens once a month? Or is it even less frequent than that?- It would be less frequent than that even. So- From a volunteering standpoint you want to be able to get home at the end of the school day, and help mom do these things. Yes, that happens more frequently. Yes. So in the last year, how many of those do you think he, he attended with you? Where he was helping out pack things, or in the library or filing? Not you personally with him- Let's go two or three- Two or three. Just things have been so chaotic, really. Okay, great. That's the end of this, but this is start for the most part when you.\n",
            "finishAnd so for this section, I'm going to ask about academic programs and employment and volunteering activities that he's been involved in since May of this year. But first I'd like to get an idea of how he normally spends his time. So what does a typical week look like for him? How has he been spending his time? He spends about eight hours a day on campus. He is living at home. So he'll spend eight or nine hours a day on campus, either in class or he loves to explore  kind of wandering around. He's got several different places he likes to go. They have a little coffee shop. He loves their coffee. Once he gets home from school, he's got a little bit of decompression time. So he'll spend an hour or two watching YouTube videos, playing on his phone. We have two cats. So he'll pet the cats, that kind of thing. Then picks back up with homework, depending on how long he's got of homework. He'll kind of, he likes to include the family, especially in the Bible study. He really enjoyed that. So we spend a little bit of time doing homework and then usually he'll watch if there's a... He got really into soccer. So there was some soccer, there's hockey, he'll watch a game on TV or kind of back to being on the phone, texting, YouTube, that kind of thing. Great. And so how many total hours per week do you think he spends with any school related activity? Outside of classroom activity or any school? Yeah, so it can be in class in addition to like studying or time on campus, just any school related activity hours total throughout the week. Gotcha. He's on campus for about eight hours. And I'd say he usually does an hour to two hours of homework a night, so, and excluding weekends. So he is looking at eight to 10 hours. Okay. And so is that eight to 10 hours? Five days a week? Yes. Okay. So it sounds like about up to 50 hours a week? Yeah. Okay. And so- Of course, some of that's getting a coffee and walking by the water and doing... It's not all fully active learning time. And so yeah, with Trevecca University, can you tell me a little bit about the program? Yeah, he is actually in his first semester working on a degree. They have a five year CPA program. So he's working on his degree in accounting. So this semester he had just intro, your standard first semester intro classes, intro to biblical faith. He had a financial stewardship class. He had history, fine arts, and I'm forgetting a class. Oh, Life Calling and Purpose, which is like a freshman seminar class for them. So they took about 20 kids. They put them into groups of 20 and they work on leadership and volunteering. The Nazarene doctrine that Trevecca follows is very big on sharing your gifts with your community. So working on... That's where they did a lot of their volunteer work. That's great. And is he pursuing a bachelor's degree currently? Yes. And is this an autism or disability specific program? It is not. Okay. And you mentioned his area of study is accounting. And what's the average number of classes that he takes per semester? Somewhere between 14 and 17 credit hours. 14 and 17 credit hours. So I imagine is that like five classes? Somewhere in the five to six classes. And what month and year did he start going to classes there? August of this year. And earlier you were talking about the supports he received. So what types of supports does he receive there? Right now we meet each semester to discuss based on the class load that he's taking, what supports that he's going to need. They record all their classes. So we limited the supports, because he can always watch the videos at home, but they offer note takers. They offer... He's taking tests separately. He goes to disability services to take his test one on one, that kind of stuff. Mm-hmm . And so do you feel this program has been a good fit? Oh, absolutely. I imagine. Just checking in. So what makes it a good fit? I'll tell you for him. It is the size. His high school, we had about 2100 people give or take at any point in time and there's 1500 undergrads at Trevecca, so it's a small school where he's got the ability to build relationships and already... Like when he took that test, when the lady from disability services called the teacher, the teacher was already familiar with him. Oh I know  and that... And she knows that Benny's a good writer. So I... Oh, I read that paper he wrote. He did a good job on the writing. He understands more than he showed. So it's... The size gives him the ability to build those relationships where once people know him and understand him, he's just Benny. Mm-hmm . You said the size helps him get to know people? Yeah. That's great. And do you have any additional comments about Trevecca? I just, yeah. I have millions of additional comments about Trevecca. It just has been a perfect fit for him. That's great. And so earlier, too, when we spoke with him, we were talking about how he was volunteering in the community. So do you know where he was volunteering or what the name of the program was? Well, it's the specific things they were doing was through his Life Calling and Purpose class. So it's through the school. So Trevecca sent during their orientation, sent his group of 20, went out to Glencliff High School, and they cut back weeds and helped beautify the campus. There were other times through that class where they did packing food boxes on Trevecca community churches on the campus. So they do some volunteer work through the church. So it's all campus based. As projects come up, they use the students through those classes and then moving through as he moves out of this class, they'll be more, he'll have to find his opportunities on his own. Mm-hmm . And so does he receive supports while participating? Yes. And- That would just be the teacher or the people in the class that were... He had never, he told me he used scissors to cut the grass and it was actually those great big... He's never done gardening of any kind, but it was the big snipers cutting back, the weeds, invasive weeds so... But they showed him, the group showed him how and hopped right in with no problem. Oh, great. And was he paid at this activity? No. And how many hours per week was he participating in it? I... It would not be a set hours per week. They were more as things come up, let's call it an hour to two a week. Because throughout it's like an eight hours here, but a one hour there and a two hours there kind of thing. And do you remember the month and year he started? That would've been in August. And- Wait did they go July? No, that was August. And what month and year did he... Because I remember you said that it kind of paused. When did it kind of come to an end? This class will... It ended in December. In December. Okay. And do you think it was a good fit for his skills and interests? Oh, absolutely. And what made it a good fit? For him it's just exploring something new. Something he never... There was a variety of different things that he could find what he liked. They have a... That led him to kind of pushing him going forward. They have a urban farm. And so that seems like something that he would enjoy. So I'm kind of, as you need to volunteer, that might be a good place for him to look. That's great. And you mentioned earlier that this is a class that ended, but it's going to start up next semester? No, the class ended, but he's still going to have- Oh okay. He's going to have to find his own volunteer hours. Yeah. But they armed them with some ideas and places they can look. Mm-hmm . Okay. And so now, were there any other volunteering or employment activities that he has been involved in since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And so now we will continue to talking about his goals. One moment.\n",
            "finishOkay. And just confirming that he has been enrolled in a college program since the last time we spoke in May. Yes. So for this section I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's attended since May of 2021, the last time we spoke. But first I'd like to get an idea of how he usually spends his time. So what does a typical week look like for him? And how has he been spending his time? How? Oh, I'm sorry. The direction was coming through. No problem. Okay. So you said what has? Okay. So what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? He goes to class, I'm going to get rid of this. Okay. He goes to class, a full time and he also attends study halls through CAP. They have mandatory studies. He sees tutors there, receives counseling there. He chooses to go. There is a Christian organization on campus. He is involved in activities through there on Wednesday nights, as well as social events through CAP every Tuesday. And then they have events kind of spread out throughout the semester. He usually attends church on Sunday morning and he has people that he has meals with. He lives in a dorm room by himself. He comes home about one weekend a month. And that's probably about it. Yeah, he sounds very busy. I don't see him a lot so... And so how many total hours does he spend participating in class or class related activities like studying or...? Gosh. I told him, I said it would be like it's full time job so it should be 40 times. I'll say 30, probably 35 hours a week. Okay. And so you mentioned that he is going to the Kelly Autism Program at Western Kentucky. And can you tell me a little bit about this program? First of all, they all have a case manager who just kind of looks out for them and they can be kind of like a middle man type. They can play that role between him and his instructors. He can just go to them if he has issues that he is not sure how to deal with. He can go to them for things like that. They let parents know if there is something they think is troubling going on. They're kind of watching out for things that parents would want to be aware of. They're keeping up with his grades and making sure that his grades don't start to fall, or figure out why and what assistance he might need in that case. I guess that they did provide the counseling. They encourage social events and post social events, several different times, weekly. And then there's certain special things that they do throughout the semester as well. That's pretty much what they do. That's great. And so this is, just confirming this is an autism specific program? I'm sorry, this is a what type of specific program? Autism specific program. Oh, yes. The students must have been diagnosed, you have to show proof of a diagnosis of autism in order to be a part of the program. And does he engage in vocational activities as part of the program? Not at this point, there's not really any specific vocational there. They do offer some assistance once he's closer to graduating. And there are things over the summer that they offer for an additional cost that we haven't taken part in, but that's something that like I said, something they offer but we have not been involved in those services. Okay. And is he taking classes with other students without disabilities? Yes. And does he take some or all of his classes with students without disabilities? All. Okay. And is he currently pursuing a degree? Yes. And what is the degree that he's pursuing? It's environmental science is the major, but a bachelor's degree, I'm not sure of that. And what is the number of classes that he's taking per semester on average? About four. Okay. He stays full time, but we don't push it. We try to keep it manageable. And so you mentioned he is full time? Yes. Okay. And do you remember the month and year he started this program? Let's see. He graduated 2019, so it would've been August 2019. Okay. And does he receive supports as part of the program? Support? Mm-hmm . Like supports or accommodations? Well, so we work through the unit. It's kind of a combination. They tell that there's also an office of accommodation, probably has a different name and I'm just not thinking of it right now, but through Western Kentucky. So he can choose to take tests separately and have additional timeline tests, things like that. That has worked out through both the Kelly Autism Program and accommodation office at Western Kentucky. They kind of work together on that. That's great. And do you feel that this program has been a good fit for him? Yes. And what's made it a good fit? Just that they, it's somebody to watch out for him, he can live independently to an extent, but then he needs a little guidance when his parents are not around just to help him to make decisions and point things out that he might not recognize those issues that he needs to deal with. They also communicate with the instructors or the professors to let them know kind of the issues that these students have, if they don't know much about autism or the specific needs of the student, they help to educate the instructors and professors on that. Great. And do you have any additional comments about this program or anything that you would like to explain further? It's very beneficial, been really beneficial for him too. That's wonderful. And has he been enrolled in any other school or programs since the last time we spoke? I don't think, just beyond campus like Christian ministry, but not, I don't think there's really anything else. Okay. And is he currently participating or has he participated in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke in May? Vocational, volunteer, and what was the third? Employment. Employment, yes. He worked a job over the summer. He worked at a  in Henderson, so he had a job through the summer when he was at school. Great. And so that was summer of 2021? Yes. And did he receive supports or was he working independently? He was working independently. And what was he doing there? Can you describe the activity? From what I understand he was working a foam machine that used to make thermal containers. Okay. And you said earlier that he did not receive supports or accommodations? No, he did not. And I imagine he was paid at this job? Yes. And how did he find this job? A neighbor recommended applying for it. And on average, how many hours a week did he work at this job? 40. And do you remember the month and year he started and left? He left in August. He started in probably June, July. Yeah, I think it was June to August. Okay. And do you feel like this was a good fit for his skills and interests? No, but it was a summer job which is temporary, but yeah. No, he doesn't want to do that for the rest of his life. Yeah. What made it not the best fit? He wants to do something in environmental studies and help the environment. And so this was just a way to make money but it's just not what he wants to do. It's not related to his major, it's something to make money. And what was his reason for leaving this job? Because he was going back to school. Okay. And has he participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And so now we'll move on to talking about some goals that we set last year.\n",
            "finish... about what you do with Unboxed, and I just wanted to check in and see, do you feel that that job has been a good fit for you? Yeah, I guess. I mean, it fits right now, but yeah. You know? Yeah. I mean, get tired of doing it, but yeah, it's pretty good. And do you have any additional comments about this job? No. Okay. And just wondering, so you said that you guess it's a pretty good fit. What makes it a good fit for you? Or why is it a good fit for you? I don't know. It just does. I mean, I guess it gets me out of the house kind of, so it's something, I guess, you know? Okay. So now we talk about ...\n",
            "finishFirst of all, thank you so much for speaking with us and for doing this, we really appreciate your time. No problem. So first, I'll be talking to you just really briefly about jobs that you've been involved in, and seeing what you think about them, and your school program. And then, we'll talk about some goals that you just heard about and you'll let me know what your favorite ones were. Okay. Okay, so, the school that you go to now, the Kelly Autism Program at Western Kentucky, do you think that this program has been a good fit for you? So far, yeah, it's been a little bit... it took some time getting used to, and stuff. But, as far as the people there, and I guess, my case manager, as far as I can say, it's been pretty good as far as the people who are there and stuff, to help and stuff. Yeah, that's great! And, is there anything else that you'd like to tell me about your feelings on this program, and if not that's fine. Well, I'm not trying to really be some weird or anything, but I hope to kind of get a little bit more independence one day, because apparently, if you're a junior or senior, they give you more free options and stuff, to do and more, and they're not as involved then, so, what you did... Yeah. So, it sounds like you're just really looking forward to that part of the program. A little bit. Yeah, and that's not weird at all. That definitely makes sense. And then, switching gears a little bit, or actually, another educational program, your mom mentioned that you got some tutoring last year at Val State. Did you think that was a good fit? I do, actually. Yeah. And what made it a good fit? I'd say they just really pointed the most important things out, and I got to kind of learning about what to actually look for and we might... That sounds great! And, is there anything else that you'd like to say about that program and if not, then we can move on too. No, I don't really have anything else to say about it. Okay. Now, so switching gears a little bit to Texas Roadhouse, do you think that this job has been a good fit for you? Yeah, it has. I really like the people who work there, and they all seem to be really caring and everything, and everybody who works there pretty much gets along with each other and... That's great, and is there anything else that you'd like to add about this job? Well, the only thing I'm possibly thinking about, like my mom was saying, I'm really trying to get into some other things. For instance, working at a summer camp or something, because I really want to be involved more like with people, and everything, and I do like kids a lot, and I really want to be able to just sort of do things with them and kind of, and meet other people while doing something that I really enjoy. Yeah, that's definitely understandable. And I hope that you are able to explore those other options. Okay, so now, switching gears...\n",
            "finishSo, I just wanted to confirm that he is out of high school. He is. And did his high school track or plans change since the last time we spoke with you last June? No, I don't think so. And what month and year did he exit the school system? May of 2019. Okay. May of 2019. And what type of diploma did he receive? Special education. Special education diploma. Okay. And so now we'll talk about some activities that he's been involved in after high school. So for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's participated in since last June 2020. But first I'd like to get an idea of what a typical week looks like for him. So what does a typical week look like for Ashton and how has he been spending his time? He's fairly independent. So currently on Tuesdays and Thursdays I pick him up for him to run his business, which is a cardboard recycling business. So he runs a little route and goes to businesses and houses and picks up cardboard. And up until last week for approximately three months, he had an activity coordinator that took him out on Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoons to go work out at the gym, go walk at the park, grocery shop, and go to a little cafe restaurant. And usually does at least one family dinner with us a week. It's really up to him. He kind of likes to be alone, so it's not his favorite activity to come hang out with the family. Yeah. He is on a pretty good schedule. So he typically mows his yard on Monday and we have other house cleaning activities scheduled out, but it takes a lot of prompting. So I hang out with him and help him walk through laundry and washing dishes. He has a cat, so taking care of his cat. And then he pretty much just likes to play video games. That's kind of where he is at. And so with his business, is he doing that independently or with support? Oh, no. I basically run everything and he just does most of the physical labor. I do have to help him with some of the physical labor. He just does the labor part. He doesn't actually contact the customers, or acquire the customers, or schedule anybody, or anything like that. And is that job for pay? Yes, he does get paid. Great. And how many hours a week do you think he works at this job? About four to five a week. Four to five, okay. Four to five hours per week. Okay. And now we'll talk about some educational activities. Is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program or vocational school or community college or university since we last spoke in June 2020? No. Okay. And now we'll talk about his job. So you mentioned he's currently participating in a job and he is working with your support, correct? Yes. And what is the name of his agency or business or company? It's called UnBoxed. Oh, that's such a good idea. And can you describe the activity and what he does there? He takes residential and commercial cardboard and takes it to the recycling center. Okay. And he receives supports while participating. What type of supports does he receive? I do all the transportation, all the scheduling, and acquiring customers for him. And I do basically all the communication for him. And he is paid at this activity, correct? Mm-hmm . And how did he find this job? My husband and I created it for him. That's great. And you mentioned he works four or five hours a week doing this. Yeah. And what month and year did he start it? I believe we started in March of this year. And do you think it's been a good fit for his skills and interests? I think it's been a good fit to help him financially support himself. I don't think he's necessarily overly interested in it. He doesn't see necessarily the immediate reward of being paid because he's not typically paid by the customer, it's paid through a credit card option. And so he's money motivated. So when he doesn't see the money handed to him in his hand, he's less motivated to do it. But it does help him financially be independent. And do you have any other comments about this job? No. It's a pretty good option for him. I think I just wish that as parents, we weren't the ones having to spearhead his future fully on our own like we are. But he needed something to do and services weren't happening. And so like most parents, make sure our kids are getting what they need to get out of life. Well that's wonderful that you could do that for him and provide that for him. Yeah, it's a lot. I imagine. It's a lot on my end. Oh yeah. I can imagine. And has he participated in any other employment, vocational, or volunteering activities since we last spoke in June 2020? He has gone through a job skill evaluation program. I think that was about four meetings for someone to evaluate what his strengths and weaknesses might be. And so he went through this job skill evaluation program, but was not working in the community at this time. He was not, no. Okay. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share? No, I think we covered everything. Okay. Wonderful. Well, if-\n",
            "finishReceiving services through the school system, and he's in a transition program. Yes. You mentioned that he will be exiting the transition program in May? Yes. You mentioned earlier that he is currently working, and he has one job working at Kroger? Yes. Does he receive payment at that job? He does. Let's see. And how did he find this job? Vocational rehabilitation. What month did he start working there? And year. 12 of 2020, December. Okay. Is this part of school programming? No. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about what he does there? Yeah, he is a bagger. Which is for a guy that's not social, it's not the ideal situation for him, but he is doing well. They are very slowly but surely letting him do other things like sweeping. But, mostly he does the bagging of the groceries. Earlier you were talking about supports that he receives like best buddies. That's through ECF? Yes. That's a job coach? Uh-huh . Does he receive any other supports? Yes. His behavior analyst is with him on his job right now. That's great. Do you think that this job has been a good fit for his skills and interests? No. What makes it not a good fit? Well, he's not social. So, demanding him to speak to the customers and whatnot is not a strength of his. I think he's definitely risen to the occasion, but I wouldn't say that a social type job is something that would be the best suited for his skillset. He's not as social guy. Has he worked and left any jobs other than Kroger since the last time we spoke in May? No. What about volunteering in the community? He hasn't done that since he's been working. Okay. Earlier you mentioned, and I just wanted to make sure we touched on this, that he was supposed to get 18 hours at Kroger when he was hired, but he's only getting four. Yes. Yep. Okay. And so, now we'll move on to talking about goals that we set.\n",

            "finishJust confirming he is out of high school? Did his high school track or plans change since the last time we spoke? No. What month and year did he graduate high school, or exit the school system? May 2019. May 2019. Okay, great. What type of diploma did he receive? Just regular. It wasn't any type of special diploma. For the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities for him that he's attended since June of last year. What does a typical week look like right now for him? How has he been spending his time? He is, right now, actively trying to find work for the summer. We just got back from a trip to visit my parents over Mother's Day weekend. He really doesn't have a routine yet, since he's been out of school. Nothing's routine right now, yet. Since it's summer, he is not currently involved at school right now? Correct. Okay. Would you say that he's currently enrolled in school? Yes. Okay, great. That's what I thought, just wanted to make sure. You said that it is the Kelly Autism Program? Well, he's enrolled at Western Kentucky University as a regular student, but he has support from the Kelly Autism Program. Western Kentucky University. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about the program? They provide social opportunities. He has, I want to say, an advisor. Or, I'm trying to think of what his... He has one person who is assigned to him that's an advisor. They keep up with what his needs are, what his grades are. They are a go between with him and his instructors if there become any problems. Also, making sure that the instructors know what his special accommodations are. They are somebody that he can go to just if he has a problem, if he's not feeling comfortable with something. They offer tutoring. They offer counseling. They have mandatory study tables there, and that's part of their program that he goes over to their facility and the study tables for a mandatory number of hours every week. That's great. That sounds like a group program. Yes. Do they engage in any vocational activities as part of the program? They do. He just finished his second year, but actually over this summer they were already giving options for students to come and do independent living skills. Also, there were some jobs that were in the bowling green area that, if they wanted to live there over the summer, they could hook them up with different facilities or companies that would allow for them to have jobs there and that type of training. Is he participating in, or has he participated in any vocational activities as part of the program? No, not yet. Not yet. Okay. Is he taking classes with other students without disabilities? Yes. How many of his classes? Some or all? Every. All. All. Okay. What is his area of study? Environmental studies. Environmental studies. Just wanted to double check too, what type of degree is he seeking? For instance, a bachelor's degree or associates? Yes, bachelor's. Bachelor's. Okay. What's the number of classes on average that he is taking per semester? 14 hours, or four classes. I imagine that's considered full-time? Yes, he's considered full-time. Do you remember the month and year he started this program? Yes, that would have been August 2019. Okay. You mentioned he received supports from the Kelly Autism Program. What supports do those include? What does what include? What type of supports are included in his program, or does he receive? That's what I was telling before, as far as having the, you know... The advisor He's got the one person who he goes, I can not think of what they call, it's like a case manager, but it's not, that's not what it's called. He has one person who is assigned to him, an adult that works in the program that keeps up with what classes he's taking, how he's doing. They're a go between for him instructors to make sure that the instructors know what his accommodations are. And then if there would be any problems that came up, I can ask that... I can't think what of they call him... to go to the instructors and try to work on communication between them. Also, sending us grades, letting us know if they notice anything that's out of the ordinary or troublesome, to make sure that we're aware if anything is going on. There's the counseling, there's the tutoring, and there are the social programs as well. He hasn't taken advantage of the vocational training or the job training, but they do offer that as an additional fee. We have not taken part in that yet. You mentioned that his advisor can make sure that instructors know about his accommodations. What types of academic accommodations does he receive? As far as additional time for tests and a separate location to take tests? Have you felt that this program has been a good fit for him? Yes. What makes it a good fit? Just so that he has the resources there. He does definitely use the tutoring. He also definitely needs... The counseling has been beneficial. College is a stressful time for a lot of kids and as it is for him, and so he's used those services. And then just to get to know other kids by doing some of the social activities that are planned and feeling like he's part of, it's kind of like a family away from home. They look out for him and his needs and let us know if there's anything that seems to be out of the ordinary for him, or that we need to know about to try to resolve issues. That's great. Do you have any additional comments about this program or anything that you would like to elaborate on? I don't think so. Okay. You mentioned that he's not currently working, but that he was working until last summer. I think earlier you mentioned that he left at the end of summer, so he was working between June and now? Yes.  Okay. And was he working independently or with support? Independently. Okay. And you mentioned, I think, it was Texas Roadhouse? Yes. What did he do there? He was a busser. Cleaned tables and took trash out and things like that. Did he receive any supports while working? No. I imagine he was paid at this activity? Yes. How did he find this activity, or this job? It was recommended that he go there by his... There was a counselor at the high school, because he got the job while he was still in high school initially. They just recommended that it was a good place to work and that they were nice people. So he went and applied. No special help with that. Just went and applied and interviewed and got the job. Oh, that's awesome. How many hours a week did he work there? He was doing approximately 20. 20 hours a week. Okay. Do you remember the month and year he started this job? That was the beginning of, probably, May 2018. Do you remember the month and year he left? August 2020. Did you feel like this was a good fit for his skills and interests? It was. It worked out well. Yeah. What made it a good fit? Probably, because it was very routine. Kind of doing the same...There wasn't a lot of change. It was a lot of the same type of expectation I'm trying to think of any other reasons. The hours worked out well. That's about it. Do you have any additional comments about this job? No. What was his reason for leaving? He was going back to school and just decided he to didn't want to stay on the payroll. Has he participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since June of 2020? No. Is there anything else that you would like to tell us, or any other updates you would like to share with us? No, that's about it.  Okay, great. Well, thank.\n",

But first I'd like to get an idea of how he spends his time. So what is the typical week look like for him? How has he been spending his time? He spends his time... Someone watches him from when I drop him off in the morning until when I pick him up in the evening, when I get off work. So his day is spent either watching TV or playing games or something like that. Someone watches him. Is that you or me? I don't think I hear anything. Somebody's calling me. That's what it is. Oh, sorry about that. Shoot. So, and I can make this really simple. Okay. So, the only outside activity he's done, he goes to church on Sundays. And other than that, that's his week. And on Saturdays we try to go on a drive, we'll go somewhere, we may go to the aquarium or something like that, because he's been kind of indoors all weeks, I try to make it special for on Saturdays.

It's just kind of boring what we do the same... We have a routine. We not doing anything else. Oh no.

            "finishJust confirming that he is out of high school and has been out of high school? Mm-hmm . Okay, and so for this section I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's been involved with since the last time we spoke in June of this year. But first I'd like to know what a typical week looks like for him. So what does a typical week look like for him, and how has he been spending his time? Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. No, Monday, Thursday, Friday, he works 11:00 to 3:30. Tuesday, he does not work. Wednesday, he works from 11:00 to 5:30. And at Culver's, he's a runner, and he's involved in Borderless Arts Tennessee, and that's for the disabled. Well, it's an organization for the disabled, for the arts, whether it be performance, visual, or musical. That's amazing. And so is he... It's really cool. ... volunteer there? Well, no, they have workshops. Oh, workshops. So like a participant? Yes. Oh, excellent. That sounds like so much fun. It's really cool. So I was trying to do the math in my head really quickly. But if you know off the top of your head, how many hours would you say he normally works per week at his job at Culver's? Oh, it's 11, 12, one, two, 12, one, two, three, so four and a half hours, three days a week. Okay, so let's see, four and a half times three... That's 13 and a half. Mm-hmm . 13 and a half, and then he works 11:30 to 5:30, so that's six hours. So that's about 19 and a half hours per week? Yes, that seems right. And does he work with supports or does he work independently? He works independently, well, no, that's not true. I'm there, I used to just sit in the lobby while he worked in case he had an anxiety attack. Mm-hmm . Or a full blown panic attack. So I was his support while he worked. And then when they got down, they just had no employees, and really struggling. Since I had sat out in the lobby for years, they had said, \"Well, would you like to work? We'll let you work Austin's schedule.\" And I was like, \"Well, yeah.\" But I work 11:00 to 3:30 five days a week. So mine is just a little different from his, but not much. That's great that you're able to support him there. I hope. Okay. And, so one moment, and then we'll continue. Sure. Okay. And is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in any academic program? Oh, sorry. Give me just a second. Oh, sure. It's okay. It was bound to happen. Hey there. Hey, so is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college, college or university since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And so now I'd like to know more about his job. So you said that he works at Culver's, and he's a runner. So what does he do at his job? What do I do, or what does he do? What does he do? He's learned how to do set. And that's where, when the food comes from the kitchen and it's been prepared, and it comes down the chutes, then he has learned to read the ticket, put what's needed in the bag to complete the order that has come down the chutes, and how to fulfill the order. And then as a runner, he takes it from set to the car, or to them in the dining room. So that's pretty cool. Yeah, that's awesome. And so you mentioned that he received supports from you being there with him? Mm-hmm . And you said that you used to support him by being available in the lobby as needed in case he had an anxiety attack? That was not this year. Okay, and what... That was before. And what did it look like this year where you work his schedule, and what does that support look like now? We've discussed where he should go when he gets overwhelmed and wants to block everything out. Then he had been going into the employee's restroom, but he would lock the door from inside, and then he would sit in a corner under the sink. Mm-hmm . And then when we realized he'd been gone, and then we realized we can't find him, then they come get me, and I start looking in his usual places. And then I went to the restroom, but the manager has to unlock the door to let me in. And it's really tough because then everybody has to cope with me being pulled as well as him not being in his position. So they're suddenly covering two positions and doing their own things. Mm-hmm . And I guess that's really hard on Culver's when that happens, but they are super amazing. They're just really amazing. Well, I'm really glad that they're so supportive. They're very good to him. It sounds like he receives supports from you, as well as some supports from them? Mm-hmm . Yes. And I imagine he is paid at this activity? He's what? I imagine he's paid at this activity? Yes. At this job? How did he find this job? Well, we were over there doing a Spirit Night, which is where the business gives a percentage of sales for that evening to the nonprofit, and the other kids in the special needs sports foundation that Austin has been a part of, they were there running the food to the customers. How old was he? He was 17. And the owner of the business was there, and he came to me and he said, \"If he ever wants a job, you come here.\" And so that's all. That's wonderful. And do you remember the month and year he started at that job? June of 2016. Oh, wow. That's quite a while. Mm-hmm . Five years. That's amazing. I know, right? That's a huge accomplishment. It's pretty great. It's a huge accomplishment. And so has it been a good fit for his skills and interests? Yes. And what's made it a good fit? The coworkers that are there are his friends, meaning he sees them as his friends. And so that is... When he was in school, he really, really struggled with typical peers, neurotypical peers. He just didn't understand facial expressions, and tone of voice, and sarcasm, and so he would get very upset and very overwhelmed very easily. Whereas with this job, the people who work there were very interested in him, and some of the coworkers have developed friendships outside of Culver's with him. That's amazing. And it's just really neat. Well, I'm really glad to hear that. And do you have any additional comments about this job? No. Okay. And has he participated in any other employment, vocational, or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke in June? No. Okay. And so, now we'll move on to talking about the goals that we set last year.\n",
            "finishYou mentioned that he is in college at Volstate. Mm-hmm . Did his high school plans or track change since the last time we spoke, like his planned graduation date, for instance? No, his graduation date didn't change, but he'd applied and gotten into MTSU. But because of COVID, they weren't allowing freshmen to come and live on campus so that changed his plan. And so he graduated May of 2020? So his graduation, I mean, technically, school finished in May but he didn't walk until the end of June because COVID. Okay. And what type of diploma did he receive? Regular. Okay. So for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's been involved with since last May of 2020. First, I'd like to get an idea of how he normally spends his time. So what does a typical week look like for Nathan? How has he been spending his time? So he works 40 hours a week. Oh, wow. He has two, three credit hour classes that he does online. He goes to the sense lab on Saturday for the sense theater study. Oh that's good. He's doing the course. And then when he's at home, he does chores and he likes to play VR or computer games, or Pokemon Go. Oh, that sounds fun. Yeah. And wow, that sounds like a lot on his plate. So he works 40 hours a week and then does two, three credit hour classes. So is that about 46 hours that he is involved in these activities per week? I don't know that school takes six hours a week? It probably takes closer to four, even though they're three credit hour classes, but I would definitely say four. Okay. So you mentioned that he's enrolled in Volstate, can you tell me a little bit about the program? So he's on track to get an associate's degree in computer science. So he's knocking out his gen ed. And is this an autism or disability specific program? No. I didn't think so. Just needed to confirm. And it's a two year college. Mm-hmm . And you said that he's doing computer science and he's taking two classes right now. So if he's taking two classes, would he be considered full-time or part-time? Part-time. And do you remember what month and year did he start this program? Was that August of 2020? It was. Okay. And does he receive supports from the program? Yes. And what supports does he receive? Academic advising and then he gets accommodations through the access center. The access center? Mm-hmm . And what kind of accommodations are those? So the Glean note taking software, and then he gets additional time on tests and additional time on quizzes. And do you think that this program has been a good fit for him? Yes and no. And why or why not has it been a good fit? Well, it's been good in the sense that it allows him to go at his own pace, you know, with an asynchronous class you can take six hours to do the work, or you can take three hours to do it, but it's nice that it's at his own pace and that it's not as much pressure to do asynchronous from home. But on the flip side, it's not as neatly structured and I think Nathan tends to benefit from a more structured educational environment. So you say yes or no for a good fit. Is there any way that you think that you would be leaning towards... Oh, because you have to code it one way or the other? And if you can't decide, that's completely fine. I know that there's a lot that goes into these. That it's a very nuanced thing, especially right now with virtual and everything. If I could only say yes or no, then I would say no. Okay. And do you have any additional comments about this program or any circumstances that you would like to explain? Oh, no. I mean, other than what I said, it's nice in the sense that he can do it at his own pace, but he benefits from more structure. Mm-hmm  and was there any other school or program that he attended since last may that was post high school? No. So now we'll go into speaking more about the jobs that he's been involved in. Earlier you mentioned that he is working at Walmart. Can you describe the activity and what he does there? He pulls and packs online orders. Okay. So he pulls and packs online orders. And does he receive supports while participating? No. And is he paid at this activity? I'm assuming yes. Yes. How did he find this job? Oh, his friends were working there. And you said earlier that he works 40 hours a week? Mm-hmm . And do you remember the month and year he started? No, but it was... It might have been last April but I'm not positive. Okay. And do you think that this has been a good fit for his skills and interest? No. And why not? Nathan's really smart and I tend to think that kind of job, it might be something that he can do well without having to give it a lot of attention, but I think he's really bright and he should be in a job where he's challenged. And do you have any additional comments about this job? No. Has he participated in any other employment, vocational, or volunteering activities since May of 2020? Other than the sense lab, and I don't know if that would fit in line with vocational, I think it's something he's volunteered to do because it is voluntary, but I don't know if that fits the category. Sorry, I couldn't hear the last thing you said,\"I'm not sure if...\" what? Oh, if it fits in this category. Mm-hmm  I think you'd mentioned that he was a host at Chili's, I'm not sure if this was something that he was still doing after May of last year though, but I just wanted to double check. No. Okay. He definitely was not at Chili's in May. Okay. Is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share? No. Okay. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us today, as this would not be possible without your participation, and we really appreciate-\n",
            "finishIn fact, he's been out of high school and not receiving services through the school system, and that he did not exit the school system since the last time we spoke. He's been out of the school system, is that correct? You mean out of the public school system? Mm-hmm . Yes. And so for this section, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's attended since the last time we spoke. But first I'd like to get an idea of how he normally spends his time. So what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? So he takes 12 credit hours at Vol State. So he's a full-time student and then he works part-time at Walmart. So about 15 hours a week at work, and then he plays computer games or studies, does chores. Great. Cook, fold laundry. And so,... with schooling and work, how many total hours does he spend with school related activities and working total? So I know you mentioned that he does 15 hours a week at Walmart and 12 credit hours at school and that he studies. So I just wanted to factor in kind of like the hours that go into studying, as well as hours spent physically in class. Okay. Let me see, I definitely say 40 hours. 40 hours combined with these activities? So that includes working at Walmart as well? Yes ma'am. Okay, great. And so, now I'd like to learn more about Vol State. And so can you tell me a little bit about the program? Yeah. So, Nathan was a computer sciences major. I guess since February when we spoke and he's just changed his major to just studies. To, to what, what major? Oh, general studies. Oh, general studies. Okay. And I imagine this is not an autism or disability specific program? Correct. And is he working towards, I believe Vol State, is that working towards an associate's degree? Yes ma'am. Okay. And you mentioned that he is in 12 credit hours. So I imagine is that about four classes? Yes. Okay. And he's full time. Do you remember the month and year he started at Vol State? Let's see, that would be August 2020. Okay. And is he receiving any supports through the program? Yeah, he gets, not academic support, he gets academic guidance, I guess. That's great. And do you feel that this program has been a good fit for him? No. And why has it not been a good fit? Some of the... I'm sorry... Some of the professors are teaching the course at a much higher level than an introductory community college course would warrant. Mm-hmm . Some of... I believe some of the expectations are unreasonable even for neurotypical kiddos. Mm-hmm . So it's been, it's been a bit rocky. Mm-hmm . Yeah, that sounds stressful. Do you have any additional comments about this program? No. And has he been enrolled in any other school or programs since the last time we spoke in April? No. Okay. And so now I'd like to learn about- Actually, I'm so sorry, let me go back. It wasn't a school and I don't know that it was an academic program but he did a play. Oh. I think it was through his Transitions Lab though. Oh, okay. I wonder, so we're the Transitions Lab. But I wonder if he was doing it through the S.E.N.S.E. Lab with Dr. Corbett. Oh, yes. Blythe Corbett, yes. That's wonderful. I've heard such good things about the S.E.N.S.E. Lab. The work they do is, it sounds amazing. Well, and he really enjoyed it.  So that was really nice I'm so glad to hear that. Yeah. It always sounds like a lot of fun and so many people really, really love that program. I'm so glad he got to try that. Yeah. And, and so with working at Walmart, does he receive any supports or is he working independently? Independently. Okay. And what does he do there? He pulls online orders. And I imagine he is paid at this activity. Yes. I would hope so. And how did he find this job? A friend. And how many hours a week, you said 15? Yes. And how many, or sorry, do you remember the month and year he started working there? March 2020. And do you think it's been a good fit for his skills and interests? Yes. And what makes it a good fit? It's something that he can do without a lot of communication. Mm-hmm . And, do you have any additional comments about his job at Walmart? No. Okay. And has he been participating in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke in April? I'm not sure of any activities, other than the S.E.N.S.E. Lab, right? No. Okay. And so now we'll move on to talking about-\n",
            "finishAnd so I just wanted to ask, do you feel that your job has been a good fit for you? For who? Perfect fit. And what makes it a good fit? Because I have a good ... I'm best friends with the, oh, general manager, everyone's nice, I've memorized everyone's name, and I work well there and I feel safe there. So it's a good place to work. Well, I'm so glad to hear that. And was there anything else that you wanted to tell me about working at Culvers or any other comments about that job? No. Okay. So now we move on to ...\n",
            "finishFirst, we're going to talk about some activities that you're involved in. So your mom was saying that you are enrolled at VO state, and I just wanted to check in, do you feel that this program has been a good fit for you? The VO state? Like just the classes and college experience, I guess? Yeah. No, not really. I'm sorry to hear that. What makes it maybe not the best fit? Well, it's difficult. It's college. It's not really, nothing really entertaining there. And do you have any additional comments about VO state or any circumstances you'd like to explain or tell us about? I mean, there's some. No, not really. Okay. And your mom was also telling you're working at Walmart right now? And I was wondering, do you feel that this job has been a good fit? It's starting not to be. The pay is getting insufficient, I guess, for being a college student. Mm-hmm . But I mean, what I do there is all right. I guess. Mm-hmm . And do you have anything else that you would like to tell us about working at Walmart or your experience there? I mean, I've been working since last night. It's getting, it's the same, I guess so not really. Mm-hmm . Okay. And so now we'll move on to talking about some goals.\n",
            "finishNow we'll move on and I'll ask some questions about school and work. Let's see, just to start off with, and I know that I looked at your previous interview. I know that you said that he has already graduated from high school, but can you just kind of describe for me his high school situation? If he's graduated or is he still receiving any services through the school system or anything like that? Nothing through the school system and he's graduated. Great, what month and year did he exit high school? When did he? Oh my gosh. I think it was 2016. I'll just put May. Hold on. He was born in November of 97 and he started, first grade at six and then turned seven, just a couple of months after starting first grade. I believe... I mean, if he did like the normal amount of years, that would be 2015. Was it 2015? I was born in 95 and I graduated in 2013. Well, I mean, that makes sense. 2015, seven and 18 would be... Seven and eight is 15... Meaning the 18 and I'm taking the two right hand. I'll go with 2015. Okay. I'll say 2015. What type of diploma did he receive? Parents signed. Now I'll ask about his post high school activities. These will only be about any academic programs, employment, or volunteering activities that he's attended since the last time we interviewed you a year ago, in the past year. Okay. First, I'd like to just get an idea of how he usually spends his time and the activities that he participates in during a typical week. So, can you just kind of tell me, what does a typical week look like for Austin? How has he been spending his time? Monday through Friday, he works three and a half hours each day. He will either play on his handheld game device, or watch a movie, or play games over at the neighbor's house, which is like Domino's or cards. We've had some of his friends over occasionally. Okay. I don't know what else to say. That sounds good. Okay. Is he... he's not in a post-secondary academic program and is he working for pay with support or independently? Independently. Does he do any volunteering in the community? He has an art program that he's part of. Okay. But as far as volunteering, no. Okay. No, he doesn't volunteer. How many total hours during an average week does he spend participating in all of his vocational activities? Just his job, how many hours per week does he work? Three and a half hours, five days a week. Seven and seven, and then 14, three and a half...17 and a half. I just done the math at the same time. That's funny. Okay, so employed. Great, and you said he's not currently enrolled in any academic programs, right? No. Sorry, I usually do a different interview. I'm covering for somebody who's out this week. I'm trying to make sure... Oh, bless your heart. I'm trying to make sure I'm getting everything. No, I understand that. Can you tell me the name of the company that he works at? Folders. Oh, okay. Can you describe the activity? What he does when he is at work to the best of your knowledge. He is trained on the runner position on set, which is a specific position. Okay. He's trained on hospitality. He's completed training on all three. You said he does not receive supports while working, right? He does not have a job coach or anything like that. He's paid at this job? Yes. How did he find this job? He was in a local group and they did a spirit night. That's where, if you are a 501c3, if you need a fundraiser, then you can come and they will donate some of the proceeds during a three hour window and the participants in the 501c3 program, they are to deliver the food out to the customers. He was doing that for this local thing, he was part of a special needs sports foundation. This is pre-COVID and the owner of Culver's saw what a great job he was doing and came and said, \"if he ever wants a job, he's got one.\" Oh, wow. It was pretty incredible and he's been there five years, this month. Great. Wow. It is super exciting. So, 17 and a half hours per week. You said he's been there five years. Do you remember the month and year that he started working there? Let's see, 06 of 2016. Do you feel that this job is a good fit for his skills and interests? Yes. Can you tell me a little bit about why? Well, it keeps him social but it allows him to only interact with the public at what he likes minimally. He doesn't have to have an extended amount of exposure. When he runs the food, he reads the ticket to the people, they say yes or no, if that's their order, which, most of the time yes. If they need anything, then he runs back in and they need more crackers, then he gets the crackers and runs it back out to them. Then he says, thank you, have a good day, and he runs in.  Says what he's trained to say. He...   Doesn't have to say anything else. Seriously, he's happy because he considers his coworkers, his friends. Because he's with his friends, then he's happy and he doesn't have to talk to all the other people. Right. But a little. It, it's kind of fun, but it does keep him interacting with people. Even though it works really well for him. That's great, do you have any additional comments about this job or any circumstances you'd like to explain? Nope. Has he participated in any other jobs or volunteering activities since last year? No. That's all the questions, unless, are there any other updates or anything we didn't talk about that you'd like to share or talk about? No. Have you had any changes to your email or mailing address since your first interview a year ago? No. Well, then that is all the questions that I have. Thank you so much for sharing with me today.\n",
            "finishAnd could you describe his high school situation? You mentioned earlier that he is in high school and... Correct? Yes. He's in the exceptional Ed track. So for most of the day, he's in, I think it's two or three classrooms connected to each other. All his classmates have intellectual and physical disabilities of some sort. Well, actually they're mostly intellectual disabilities and some people also have physical disabilities. Let's see, they do most of their subjects in those classrooms. There are some pullouts for general education classes. Right now, Richard, because of behavior has not been able to be part of Gen Ed, but he does join the rest of the student body for lunch. Well, okay. Sorry that was pre COVID, during COVID they separate out the kids as much as they can during lunch, so that people aren't clustered too much. And for PE they go outside and walk around the track or whatever. And did this high school plans or track change, like for regarding graduation date, since the last time we spoke? No. And when is he planning on exiting high school? What month and year? We would like for him to exit high school in May of 2022. Mm-hmm . And earlier you mentioned that he is not currently working, and what have been the barriers to or why is he not currently working? I know you mentioned a little bit of this earlier, but just wanted to touch on this one, one more time. It's mostly the level of his intellectual disability combined with really severe OCD, attention deficit disorder, Sensory processing disorder, and inability to communicate, because of all of that and inability generally to focus on a task for more than maybe 10 minutes at a time. That's the group of things we'll be working on next year, because if we can't get his behavior under control, then he can't participate in community based learning and will be sent back to the high school to do sort of a... Oh, I forget what they call it, they call them super seniors, where they stay as long as the parents want them to stay. We prefer for Richard to not stay in a high school environment as he gets older, because he'll be a man. And we don't think that it's going to feel good to him. We feel like he'll want to be treated, not like a kid, even if his intellectual level is lower than your average person to his age. And has he volunteered in the community during high school, since the last time we spoke? He hasn't have the ability to do that. So, no. Mm-hmm . Yeah, I imagine. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share with us? I don't think so. I think I've probably been exhaustive. Mm-hmm . Well, thank you.\n",
            "finishOkay. And so just confirming that he is still in high school. Yes. And is he currently working? No. And this is just something that we ask to all families. Why is he not working at this time? Pretty much because he won't complete the application process. Mm-hmm . Okay. And a few places that he's applied to, he just hasn't gotten an interview. Mm-hmm . And so has he worked and left any jobs since the last time we spoke in May? Nope. And what about volunteering in the community? No. Okay. And so now we move on to talking about some goals that we set last year.\n",
            "finishAnd I've got this one. Okay, awesome. Thank you for that.  index for participant 1030. And for this one, Stacy, I'm going to ask you some questions about Quinn work experience in high school or volunteering experience. If he didn't have any, then just let me know, but he's still in high school, correct? Yes. He's a rising junior. Okay. Has he ever worked during high school? No. Has he ever volunteered during high school? Not in high school. Did he volunteer before high school? He did. He's done the Nashville Rescue Mission. They had a Valentine's fundraiser for Merle and he helped sell the flowers, the bookcase, and things like on the today of. Yes. He was the selling manager, and he did a really, really good job with that, and that's kind of the extent in the last few years of volunteer work that he's done. We've informally fostered some kids, and he was always very helpful with them, teaching them things and playing with them. So I would say that's a big component of volunteering that you wouldn't think, oh, I'm going someplace to do it because it was in our home, but he was- Yeah, was there foster kids younger than what he was at the time? Oh, yeah. They were nine and three, and Quinn would've been 13. So they were five years plus younger. Yes. Great. This is good information, good to know. So that is the last question. This one is really short since he's still in ...\n",
            "finishIn his program do. So they'll have them go and help run the little swag store or deliver mail to different departments, or maybe they'll have them wipe down tables after the cafeteria closes. Just little things to sort of get them feeling like they have accomplished a task. Yes. Are those changing on a weekly basis or is it like he works at the swag store for a week?  I want to say they're by semester. By semester. Yeah. And they try and sort of give the kids things that they seem to enjoy. So sometimes it changes if they're getting the feeling that there's some impatience with the tasks they've been given. So this is part of school programming. And he doesn't get any payment for doing those jobs. And what is the name of his high school? Is this at the current high school that he's enrolled in or at the previous? It's the current one. It's Hillwood High School. Hillwood? How many hours a week are they dedicating to that program or those tasks? Not a whole lot, because they have other stuff that they need to be doing for their IEPs. I'd say it's no more than two and a half hours a week. It might increase as they go along. I mean, he's going to be a junior next year and I know that after he graduates from Hillwood, what we'd like for him to do, if it still exists, given the cuts that they're experiencing in the system, they used to have a community based program where kids would go and learn specific life and job skills. And so I think the older he gets in the high school, the more focus will be thrown on the work skills. So I'm assuming next year they'll sort of ramp it up a little bit. We didn't have much of a chance to get used to what Hillwood was going to do, because he arrived there at the end of January and then we had February and half of March. So six weeks. Yeah. So this only started when he started at the new school and that was in... End of January. Well at Hillsborough, they had the same type of setup where they would have the kids do certain tasks to sort of get used to the idea of having a task and completing it. And when did that start at Hillsborough? Well, really right when they arrived. So let's see, he just finished sophomore year, so it was the beginning of his freshman year, two years ago. Do you know if the students are getting any support while doing the tasks? Yes. Well, they're at least getting supervision and input if things are going awry. So it's a supervised task. I think the only thing that... No, I think it's all supervised. It's too risky to not have it be. And do you think the types of job that he tried out just like helping out the swag store, delivering mail, wiping down tables, do you think those were a good fit for Richard's skills and interests? I don't think so. Why not? I think if he... I imagine that if he could tell me, he would prefer to be at Home Depot where they've already said that they would try and figure out a role for him. And I think he would love that. He would need a full... It's so hard because I'm trying to imagine him in a work setting and he's just... We can't even keep him seated for half an hour to do a class. So it would have to be something probably physical to keep him physically occupied. Rather than using his intellect, such as it is. I mean, he'd have to maybe help with stocking. I don't know. I mean, it's hard, it's hard to tell. I don't think that they've tried very... I think the options for what the kids can do at school are very limited. It's really hard from that small set of examples to know what would be best for him. Does Richard volunteer in the community or did he volunteer in the community during high school? No, he doesn't have the ability to, really. Yeah. So that's the end and this is the last.\n",
            "finishYes. Okay. For  1029. And has he ever  in high school? No. Okay. And what about volunteering in the community during high school, or ever? Volunteering? Well, no. No. Okay, great.  One moment. So for the next part, I'm going to ask about services.\n",
            "finishI just wanted to confirm that he is still in high school. Yes. And did his... But he is  senior. Okay. And did his high school track or plans change since the last time we spoke? Yeah, he is... We're looking at online school and maybe dropping out to do technical. And when is he planning on exiting the school system? Well, the ideal plan is that he would do another year and graduate next year. And so would that be... Do you know what month and year that would be? Oh, May of 2022. And earlier, you mentioned that he is not currently working, correct? That's correct. No. And this is just something that we ask to everyone, but what barriers has he experienced or why is he not currently working? He won't complete the application. Yeah. He won't get online with me or he just won't finish it. He wants it to be done, but he won't take the steps. Again, big picture, I don't think he understands once you do the profile online, then you have to go look for job applications. He did for Kroger and he got a rejection saying, \"We're not interested.\" And Target. So I think he was really frustrated that he could be applying to all the sorts of other places and he is not. And he hasn't worked and left any jobs since the last time we spoke? He just did a one-off mulching job for a kid in high school that does landscaping. And that was, you said one time? Yeah. So he helped with mulching? Yeah, he did a great job. That's great. And has he volunteered in the community during high school since the last time we spoke? Nope. Okay. And so now is there anything else that you would like to share with us or any other updates that you would like to share? No. Okay. Well, thank you. I think I really gave you a lot. I'm pretty sure. Yes, definitely. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today as this wouldn't be possible without your participation. We really appreciate it. Well, I know it's important and it benefits me because I'll have valuable information. It's important to know that this is hard, really hard to navigate, so thank you. Yeah, of course.\n",

Is she currently working? No. And this is just something that we ask of all parents. Why is she not working at this time? We're, I guess, in the waiting period. Mm-hmm . Of course. Yeah. More put in place to get her in position to be able to explore working. She has the desire, but it's more we're in a... I guess a waiting period. Yeah.

And now we'll...\n",
            "finishOkay. You mentioned earlier, just confirming, that he is still in high school? Right. Is he currently working? He's not. This is just something that we ask of all parents, why is he not working at this time? He's not working at this time for the main reason that we have trouble getting him somewhere. We are his transportation, and there's not another option. Getting him to and from would be difficult, but we have talked to him about it, and he does work a little bit, I should say. I'm sorry, because he dog-sits for a lot of the neighbors. Well, the ones he dog-sat the most were just moved, but he did a bunch of dog-sitting this summer for some people on the street, plus some that live not too far away. Again, we have to drive him, so that gets difficult. Then, also during school, it's hard for him to work because the schedule is so limited. I think it'll be easier after summer break. Has he worked and left any jobs since the last time we spoke with you in June? No, just one of his dog-sitting, he dog-sat all summer on a regular, standing, reoccurring basis, three days a week this summer, but that's because she's a school counselor, and was working in the hospital during the summer, but now she's back at school, so he doesn't do that. Okay, so he was doing dog-sitting regularly. Was he receiving payment, I imagine? He did. Can you tell me a little bit about what he was doing? He would go over three days a week, and walk the dog, feed the dog tricks, spend time with the dog. He would spend about an hour and a half to two hours a day with the dog. Care for her and report back to her mom, take her on long walks, and play with her, and lay on the couch to spend time with her so she wasn't home by herself for 12 hours a day. Of course. Do you feel like this was a good fit? Oh, it was a great fit. What made it a good fit? I'm sorry, what? What made it a good fit? Well, the good fit made it that there were not other people he had to interact with on a regular basis. He loves the animals. He was comfortable knowing what to do with the animal. He does better with animals than people. Well, I'm really glad that it was such a good fit, and- It was really great. What the reason that he stopped, again? You mentioned it earlier, but just wanted to confirm- It was her schedule. She didn't need it anymore because she went back to working at school instead of in the hospital, so she's only gone about six to eight hours instead of 12 to 14 hours. Oh, I forgot, he also cut someone's grass, and he would cut that every two weeks. Oh, every two weeks? Yeah, it was just her backyard that was not right up against the house. It was her back area. So, he did that every two weeks, from April till last month. Was he paid for that, as well? He was. Okay, but he did this one, the dog-sitting, it sounds like, a little more regularly? Yes, because it was... She didn't want anybody to cut grass more often than that for her, for the section of grass that it was. Then, the dog-sitting was three times a week, every week. This grass cutting, you said, was for another neighbor? It was not a neighbor, but yes, it was for another individual. Okay. You said, I think, April until... Probably till last month. Oh, wow! Well, until October, the end of October, actually, was about the time that she didn't need to cut any longer this year. Has he volunteered in the community during high school since the last time we spoke in June? He does. He still does some volunteer work for Frankie's Farm, which is the rescue. He doesn't go as often as he used to, but he still does on occasion when they need extra help. What does he do when he goes there? He just cares for the animals, sweeps, cleans stalls, cleans stone yards, feeds and waters the animals, and exercises them, and... That's great! Yeah. Okay. So, now, we move on to talking about-\n",
            "finish so first I wanted to talk to you about volunteering at AbleVoices. So do you think that this is a good fit? Do you like AbleVoices? Yeah, Jordan. Yes. Okay, great. And what makes it a good fit? Why do you like it? Why do you like able voices? To take the picture. To take the picture? Is there anything else that you like about it? Flowers. Flowers?  I think he's trying to say he likes the different places they go, whether it's taking flowers or going to the museum for statues. Oh, cool. Likes the places that you go. And you said like picking flowers or going to see statues? Yes. Did you say that? Mm-hmm  Okay, great. That sounds like a lot of fun. So is there anything else that you want to tell me about AbleVoices? Yeah. What else do you want to tell me about able voices? Can you tell her why you like able voices? They took the picture inside the- But do they do anything else that's fun. Besides picture taking? Walking around. You like walking on the field trips, seeing things. Yeah. That's great. That sounds like a lot of fun. Okay. Right. So now we're going to talk about something else. We're going to talk about some goals that you came up with.\n",
            "finishOkay. So he's enrolled in a transition program called Transition Two. And did his high school plans or transition program plans or track change since the last time we spoke? No, he's in the same track. Okay. And when is he planning on exiting? I think you said six months from now. Yeah. So May 20 he is. May 2020. And is he currently working at all? It sounded like his job at the library ended. In the school library. I'm not sure what type of activities they're doing now, randomly. Every day they do the school's recycling and that type of stuff, but if there's not too many students there, there's not too much to recycle as well. So I'll make a quick note of that. And so it sounds like he left that job at the pizza shop.  Yes. And did he receive payment at that job? He did not. He was a volunteer. Okay. So now I'll ask some more details about that past job be held. What was the shop called again? Nashville Pizza Company. Pizza company. And he found this through the transition program. And before he stopped, how many hours a week was he working there? I believe six hours. And when did he begin that job? Let's see, two school years ago. So what would that be? This is 2021. So he probably found it in August of 19. And when did that stop? March of 20. And can you tell me- You know what, maybe it's 18 then, because that seems like a very short time. Because I know he did it two school years. And can you tell me a little bit about the job and what he did? He would prepare the tables for the day. So he would come in at 8:30 AM before they had customers. He would fill the salt shakers, the Parmesan cheese, the red peppers. He would wipe the whole table and the salt shakers and the menus. Everything to set them up for the day, do all the silverware. And did he receive support while working? Yes. There was a teacher's aid with him each day. What kind of support did they provide? I think just making sure he stayed on task and if new tasks were introduced, teaching him until he had it. And it sounds like it ended just for safety and health reasons. Yes. And do you think that this was a good fit for him? Oh yes. Someplace he loved working. That's great. And his other employment training that was kind of close to a job was at the school library. So I'll make a quick note of that. And you said he was putting barcodes on textbooks? Yes. And doing some computer entry along with it. And has he volunteered in the community since the last time we spoke? He volunteers with Able Voices, the photography club to promote them in the community. He goes to the farmer's market and displays his photography and interacts with the community. That's great. That's so cool. It's a really neat club. The person that it founded the club, , her husband is a Vanderbilt professor. So they have a little bit of ties there and it's a really growing club and it's a really good thing that she's come up with. I'm so glad to hear it. That sounds awesome. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or anything you'd like to update us on? No. Just  has really been getting out there and trying new things and he's really growing as a person right now. That's awesome. I'm so happy to-\n",
            "finishAnd so earlier you mentioned that he is no longer in that transition program, correct? Correct, correct. So left transition As of end of May. End of May. Okay. Yes. And so now I'd like to ask you about what a typical week looks like for him. So how has he been spending his time lately since graduating? Well, he does AbleVoices and that's usually three days a week for him. Was it because they have an outing on Wednesdays to go to do a photography session. On Fridays, they have a kind of a work session where he volunteers and does different projects for them, or he learns about digital photo editing. And then we've had some additional classes on Thursdays and activities that he's been doing or volunteering with with the AbleVoices. That's awesome. That sounds really wonderful. Yeah. It's a fantastic program and we really become one of the kind of heavily involved people in the, his sister is working as a mentor with the program and I assist Jen Focus, the leader of it kind of as her chaperone teammate for like the field trips, making sure that she's got enough hands on deck to help all the kids that they work with That's wonderful to hear He also, yeah, we love it. And he also does a program United Sound. Now it's on summer hiatus, but it's a music program that's nationwide that teaches musical instruments to kids with special needs. And he would do that on Sundays through Belmont University. That's wonderful. Yeah. So he studied drumming last semester and he enjoyed that a lot. So it sounds like his main activities are usually AbleVoices and United Sound. Are there any other activities that he participates in? Special Olympics soccer did not resume yet until because of COVID cause Special Olympics has kind of been off the table, but I hear there's rumors that's going to start and oh, I forgot. He also did challenger league baseball in the summer. Oh that's great For two months. Yeah. So he had games on Saturdays for that. And he's probably going to join Special Olympics bowling when it starts in August. He had not done that previously because it conflicted with school but now that he doesn't have that, we're going to pick up that activity. That sounds like a lot of fun. And so earlier you mentioned that he has not applied quite yet for a post-secondary education program. No, we decided not to do that, I applied for this year, but I imagine we will apply next year for next year, the falling school year. So not 2021. And has he participated in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke with you in January? I mean his activities on Fridays with AbleVoices is kind of a volunteer activity because it's some of the work he does for her, but I mean it's an activity he's involved with anyway. So it's not a separate one, but he does do different, you know, kind of jobs for her. And, and what does he do for her when he volunteers? He may be writing thank you letters. He goes to farmers market and does the sale of the goods and then he'll do the bookkeeping involved with that, the transaction because they sell little photo cards that they've made up. They have buttons that they give out as awards for some of their events that they do. And so he helps to make the buttons for the entire group. So yeah, just different clerical kind of work or, or grunt work for her. That's great. And so do the other participants at AbleVoices also volunteer? A few of them volunteer there's 15 that are students that are kind of full time and then there's additional, maybe 10 that are kind of somewhat involved in the program. So 25 kids and I would say that are, full-time kind of volunteers, it's less than five of them that go above and beyond. That's wonderful that he's involved then is he, does he receive supports while participating in the volunteering? Just, just I support him when I'm, you know, because I'm their volunteering and the leader of the group, you know, kind of supports, but each kid does not have an individual support. We just try to let them be as independent as possible. And is he paid at this activity at all? No, they're not. And I mean he kind of earns the buttons and things, you know, like certificates, you know, but not there there's no money involved in it. And how did he find this, this opportunity? He became involved in AbleVoices when it was a program in the Williamson County Schools and his classroom was chosen for a semester long experience with photography. And then if the child liked it, they were given the opportunity to continue with the club on their own and Rhett and another student from his school love it and so they are still involved. That's great. And how many hours a week does he spend doing these volunteering tasks? So just about, would he the volunteering part of it? Mm-hmm . Not the participating part, right? Yeah, just the volunteering aspects. I would say probably three hours a week, sometimes more but pretty steady three hours every week. And do you maybe, Or maybe even four, Three to four. Okay. And do you remember the month and year that he started these volunteering tasks with AbleVoices? That is probably about the last eight months. So I would say since January January. Okay. So yeah. So in the last six months it's probably became, you know, it was just kind of a thing that started up in the last eight months. And, and do you think that this has been a good fit for his skills and interests? Oh, it's been a really good fit for him and it has expanded his interest quite a bit. That's wonderful. And so what's made it a good fit. Well, Rhett always wrote little books that he hand drew and you know, he that's been something he's done for two, three years writing little story books basically and now he uses his photography to illustrate his books. So he'll take pictures of, you know, Pokemon or other things that fit to his story and illustrate them that way. And then he also takes his pictures and then he'll put on a light board and trace the pictures and then he colors them. And so like he is, he's kind of getting into graphic design or illustration even you might say with his stories and it's just made him so much more creative and it just advanced his art a lot. That's wonderful. Yeah. It's really cool. I've got his pictures everywhere all over the wall. Oh, that's so great to hear. And do you have any additional comments about this volunteer experience? I just think it's made him communicate more. It's made him more outgoing with people, just he, he, I think even with photography now he sees more things that are out in, around him in the universe. Just made him more aware. It's just, it's been a great activity for him. That's wonderful. And is he currently participating in or has he participated in any other sorts of volunteer or vocational activity since the last time we spoke? No, that's his main volunteer activity. Okay. Okay. And just a moment and then we will switch gears one more time. Okay.\n",
            "finishTo something different where we're going to talk about the activities that she's been involved in. Okay. So she did work during high school? No. No? Okay. She got hired to be a Santa's helper at the mall, you know when you get your picture made with Santa? Oh! That's fun. And the second day she was quoting the price wrong and they fired her. Oh, so- And I felt like that was wrong, but she was so traumatized by it. And it was only another 10 days anyway, I didn't make a big deal about it. But I think legally, they should not have fired her. No, that's- That was wrong. Really messed up. But that really hurt her self-esteem. And so when she has a bad day, she'll, \"I can't even have a job. I got fired from the Santa job.\" And, yeah. Yeah, no, that sounds like discrimination. It was discrimination. Yeah. How did she find that job? Just by going to the mall? Mm-hmm . Okay. Okay. And how many hours a week did she do it when she did it? Even though it was only a little bit. Maybe like two. Two. And when did she begin working there? She worked for two days in December of, I'm just going to guess and say 2015. Okay. That might not be right, but it's close. Okay. So, just . And most times I don't even mention that for legal things because to me it really wasn't like she was working, but you guys need to know that. Yeah. Because that's one thing we want to look at too is what people on the spectrum encounter at work and their outcomes and the supports that they get. So I feel like you probably have already answered this, but I'm assuming she did not receive support while working. No. And it was not a good fit. And you said that was because. She- What? Quoting the price wrong? Mm-hmm . So I'll put discrimination against her after two days. Okay. And did she ever volunteer during high school? Not really. Okay. We volunteered at Manna Cafe one time and they work with a lot of people with disabilities. And so the young lady in charge of our volunteer day did have some type of disability and she really talked to all of us very basic, which I understood and I'm fine with, but Chloe got offended and thought she was talking to her like she was stupid. So Chloe refused to go back to Manna Cafe. Oh. So yeah, I haven't done any of that. Okay. And so now we'll talk about how she spends her time after high school. So what does a typical week look like for her now? It sounds like from what you said, it's kind of hectic. Well, before, Monday she was just home all the time. She would go to dance twice a week. Oh, what kind of dance? She does ballet and tap. Oh, that's awesome. She's found a great teacher and a great studio in Hopkinsville. And Chloe's the oldest one there and the little girls just love her. And it's just an amazing, great opportunity and place for her to feel connected because otherwise she doesn't have that belonging or connectedness to anybody or anything and it's sad because she really wants social interaction and she wants to have good friends and she wants to have good friends like you see girls have good friends in the movies on TV and she doesn't have that. And she's just lonely. Yeah. So I'm really glad she found dance friends. So her current weeks for now look like, internship. Dance and class. And let's see. So involved in a post-secondary education program. And is her internship a paid internship? No. She has to do 500 hours to graduate with social work in May. Oh, she's doing social work, that's great. Mm-hmm . And she will be really good. She's great with little kids. But we got to get through this part. And so how many total hours during the average week does she spend in class and at the internship? Internship is 22 plus 12, 34. 34, internship and three, class. That's a very busy week. That's a lot. It's the busiest she's ever been in her whole life. I imagine. So she's currently at Austin P and can you tell me a little bit about this program. The social work program? Yeah. Or about. The Full Spectrum? Yeah, just how often she spends in class and the type of degree she's getting and whether she receives accommodations. Well, so the first year Chloe went to Austin P, Austin P started their Full Spectrum Learning program for students with autism. So what that meant was once a week she would meet with the Full Spectrum people, they'd have a group class to go over whatever topics, time management, whatever, support each other. And you would have tutoring available and you would have to have so many study hours at school with a tutor every week to sign off on. And then she first wanted to do elementary education. And even with her super horrendous ACT math score, they put her in statistics the very first semester. And because I thought I'm going to let Chloe be an adult and go to college and meet with a counselor without me, because they're Full Spectrum Learning, they're going to know that she needs help in math. And I didn't figure out it was statistics till it was too late to drop it because it wasn't called statistics it was called something else. Was it called discrete math or something? Sometimes I- It's crazy. Yeah. It can be confusing. I don't know what it is. So she failed it and that really hurt her self-esteem and she took it another time and failed it again, and that hurt her self-esteem. So she switched from early education to art and I thought she might have a hard time with art because she doesn't have the best fine motor skills, even though she's a great artist. And when you go to art school, teachers really want it a certain way. And so her teacher was a jackass and he got fired because he was so rude to her. Wow. Well, I'm glad they let him go. Mm-hmm . He really. That's terrible. Was not good. So she switched from art to social work and social work has been a good fit. So she goes to regular classes, just like anybody else. And she just has the study and tutoring time and the weekly FSL check in class. And she's got great grades. She's very articulate, as long as she's listening to a topic that she sort of understands, that would not be chemistry or physics, but she gets it and soaks it in and she can just go home and write a five page paper like it's nothing. Wow! That's impressive. It is. It's really good. That's really impressive. And so last semester she made straight A's. Oh, she must be so proud. That's quite an achievement. It's really good. Because when she switched over to social work, she didn't need statistics anymore so she took the easier math. Yeah, that sounds much better. And she had a tutor and so she passed it. So this Full Spectrum program is specifically for people on the autism spectrum? With autism. Mm-hmm . Will she earn a certificate or a typical diploma? A normal degree. Mm-hmm . Oh, that's great. Yeah. There's really hasn't been many accommodations for her. I like that they mandate the tutoring and the study time. It just helps you be a little bit more accountable and organized, I think. Yeah. So mandatory study hours, you said? Mm-hmm . Okay. And so what is the average number of classes she was taking per semester? We always try to keep her at 12 credit hours. So that may have been 13 because the FSL class was one credit hour. So that sounds like four classes then at a time? Mm-hmm . It was a full load and we'd always try to make sure at least one class was totally fun, like dance or theater or. That's a good way to do it. Because she just couldn't take four hard classes at a time. And so is she now considered a part-time student now that she's working or since it's through the school is it still full time? It's full-time. Mm-hmm . Okay. And when did she start at Austin P? I'm so bad with numbers, but this is her fifth year at Austin P so. Okay. So maybe August, 2015. 19, 18, 17, 16, 15. I think August, 2015. Excuse me. Okay. So when she graduates, she will have been at Austin P for five years, which is fine because I said, \"You're going to college and you're not quitting until you graduate. I don't care how long it takes.\" And then she just got straight A's so it sounds like it really has worked out very well. So the supports that you mentioned, her receiving some mandatory study hours and then a one-on-one tutor. And what other kinds of supports and accommodations did she receive? I don't really think any. Was there any extended test taking time or deadlines? Mm-mm . She didn't want it. Nope. If you give Chloe a test, she's going to breeze through it and be done with it. She didn't want any extra time, any extra seating. They said you can take your test in a different room that's quiet with no distractions, she didn't want that. Yeah. She really didn't take advantage of any other accommodations. But I will say the disability office at Austin P is very good and Chloe knows that they're there, that's who she went to when that art professor was such a jerk and they're the one who really took care of her and he got fired, So. Okay. Okay, great. And did she ever attend any other post-secondary education program? No. And so now we'll talk about employment and volunteer activities since leaving college or high school, sorry. So she is currently participating in an internship. And what is the name of the place where she's interning. Centerstone. Oh, we have heard of them. Mm-hmm . They're a big place with lots of little offices. She works at a small office that specializes in one to five year olds. And so can you describe this activity and what she does there? Well, as far as I know, she's there to do whatever they ask her and observe and learn. And at some point she will get to lead trainings for parents and be more vocal but for right now she's observing and listening and learning. But I think she mentioned at some point she'll get to teach parents ways to help their little ones, because these little ones are there for behavioral problems, to help with that. And I think she'll be really good at it. So most of what she does now is observing? Mm-hmm . Does she have any other duties around that? Well, I mean that's been three days. Yeah. Yeah, it's been three days. They might say, go get this or bring me that or. Oh, okay. So just general kind of officey. Yeah. Yeah. But for me, I feel proud of her because she's there, she's listening, obeying, being helpful. She's on their terms, not her terms. And when you're used to being at home and having everything on your terms I think that's really good, mature, responsible. With the observing, she said, \"It's really hard because I can't say anything and sometimes I feel like I know the answers, but I can't say it. I just have to listen.\" And I'm like, \"That's a great skill to learn, to be quiet.\" Yeah. And so do you have any additional comments about this program? It sounds like the hours are kind of long, she was mentioning, but is there anything else that you'd like to add? No, I think that it's going to be really supportive. I think she'll learn a lot. I think she'll be great with little kids. I hope that the administrative stuff and the legal stuff, that she can... That'll be harder for her, I think. But I think she can still do it, as long as people teach her to. I think she'll have a lot more confidence when she completes this internship. She has pretty poor self esteem right now. Yeah. She feels very different. But it sounds like this could be a really good fit. I think so. I'm very thankful. Okay. And they know that she has autism. Oh, okay. And do they make any accommodations? I'm sure they would if she asked, like if she needed time to go sit down and decompress or take a walk I'm sure they would let her, but she hasn't so far asked for anything. And that might be the only accommodation that she might need is if she gets overstimulated to be able to walk away. Okay.\n",
            "finish... that she is in high school. I just wanted to verify that she's still receiving services through the school system. Yes. So during COVID did her high school plans change since the last time we spoke, graduation date, for instance? Yes. Wait a minute. When you say graduation date, are you meaning her per se or just in general? For instance, if she was planning on graduating, but now she's staying a semester more, or whether she's graduating a semester early, or if any plans like that changed since the last time we spoke. Okay. We did change her pathway. So her projected graduation date would be 2022, but with her pathway, she has the option to stay in school longer. She's not on the regular diploma track. Okay. So she changed her diploma plan? Yes. The plan she's on is more to work on life skills and less academics, is the pathway she'll be on, but like I said, it's been homeschooled. So a lot of those, I guess life skills things, we haven't gotten it, but as of April, we changed her pathway to less academics, more life skills. Okay. Oh, in April. That's a very recent change then. Yes. So do you know when she's planning on exiting high school? I know that you said that she has the option to stay. I think you said that her projected plan was to graduate in 2022. And would that be in May of 2022? Most likely it's May. Yes. So planning to graduate then, but then will be able to stay if she chooses to at that time? Yes. I hope that when August come, because I know we'll have another meeting, and she'll be back in person, and hopefully, like I said, once the assessments are done, I'm hoping we'll be able to gauge more where she's at or what skills that she may have lost or lacking and we can be able to plan better. But if things are good, 2022 would be her projected graduation date, unless she's not where she needs to be. Mm-hmm . Okay. She says she wants to stay in longer. So she says she wants to stay in longer. And earlier you mentioned that she is not currently working. And this is just something that we ask to everybody, but what are reasons that she is not currently working? I guess our connection was through the school vocation rehab. And for some reason, we didn't have that service this year. Both rehab would go to the school. She did a summer program with them. But I don't know if she will or will not be a candidate for it. And that's what I would like to explore. Like I said, she did the summer program where they took them around to different jobs, but I don't know really where she's at. I don't know how it's going to work out. Mm-hmm . We can pause for a minute if you need a moment. I can stop the recording and we can take a little break if you'd like. It's okay. Okay. If at any point you need to take a break, I completely understand. And we're welcome to do that at any time. We actually are very, very nearly done. I think we only have one more question. Do you feel comfortable continuing? Okay. And so earlier you mentioned that she has not worked and left any jobs since the last time we spoke, but has she had the opportunity to volunteer in the community since the last time we spoke? No. But I will tell you one thing that she has been doing that she enjoys. Just one moment. Oh, of course. Of course. No need to apologize at all. Right. But theater, she enjoys theater. That's great. We found a program where she's been doing theater online and I think she'll get the opportunity to do them in person. So she's looking forward to that. That sounds like a wonderful opportunity. I'm really glad to hear about that. And then this is the very last question. It's just if there's anything else that you would like to tell us or updates that you would like to share. And if not, that is completely fine. Yeah. I was going to say that's it. That's it? Okay, great. So she thinks her goal is to get into acting in theater. So I guess if that count as work or not, she's been doing with a company that works with kids with special needs. So that's, I guess a job opportunity. Mm-hmm . So working with a group that works with people with special needs. That's such a great resource. Okay. Well, I'm going to stop the recording.\n",
            "finishOkay. And, please describe his high school situation. Is he ... You mentioned earlier that you were homeschooling him and he's still in high school or receiving services through the school system? I'm homeschooling him, he is still in high school. Okay. And did his high school plans or track change since the last time we spoke in February? No, I don't think so. Okay. When is he planning on graduating high school or in exiting the school system? In May of this year. Oh, that's exciting. You said that he is considering going to trade school after graduating? Yes. Okay. And you said that he's currently working. How many jobs is he currently working? Just one. And does he receive payment at that job? Yes. Now I'm going to ask for more details about this paid job that he's holding. Where does he work? He works at Cicis Pizza. Zizi's pizza? Mm-hmm . Sorry, how do you spell that? C-I-C-I-S. Oh, Cicis, okay. Awesome. I used to love their pizza as a kid. And how did he find this job? Excuse me. How did he find this job? Oh, we were just applying around the neighborhood. We were just walking in. Okay. And how many hours a week on average does he work there? How many hours? Let's see. He works from 12 to five, four days out of the week, 20. Okay. Right. And you said he started in August? Yes. I want to say August. Yes. And can you tell me a little bit about the job? Like what he does there? I think he cleans tables, washes dishes and sweeps and sometimes cleans the restrooms and takes out the trash. Okay. And does he receive support while working? No. And do you think that this job is a good fit for his skills and interests? For a beginner job? Yeah. I mean, it gives him experience and he really wanted to work already. Mm-hmm . Okay. Has he worked and left any jobs since February? What year was it in February? Did we move this February or two years ago? Yeah. February of 2020. How was this year? No, he hasn't. Okay. And what about, has he volunteered in the community since February? No. Okay. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share? No. Okay.

            "finishSo first, I just wanted to talk about your college. So your dad was saying that you are enrolled at Columbia State Community College, and I was just wondering, do you feel that this program is a good fit for you? I think so, yes. I'm enjoying so far and I'm passing very steadily. I've got more classes coming up this fall. Oh, that's great. You said you have more classes coming up this fall? Mm-hmm . Great. What makes Columbia State a good fit for you? I don't know, I just like the school better because I just thought it was a little more challenging. But so far I like it. That's great. And is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about your school? Not at the moment. That's okay. And next, your dad was telling me about volunteering at Friend's Life. And I was wondering, do you think that this is a good opportunity for you or a good fit? Mm-hmm . Yeah. Great, and- I don't know if you know, but I actually used to be a day student there years ago. And of course now I'm volunteering. Oh, great. What makes it a good fit do you think? I think it's the sense of familiarity, because I used to be a day student there, so there's that. And do you have any additional comments about this program or anything that you'd like to let me know about? Not really. Okay. Just one moment and then we can continue on.\n",
            "finishOkay. And so you mentioned earlier that he graduated high school? Yes. Oh, great. And so he graduated since the last time we spoke, it sounds like. So when did he graduate? In May, at the end of May. At the end of may. Oh, that's so exciting. And so now for this section, I'm going to ask about some academic programs or employment or volunteering activities that he's attended since the last time we spoke. But first I'd like to get an idea of how he normally spends his time. So what does a typical week right now look like for him? How has he been spending his time? He reads and he games on Wednesdays and Fridays. He goes to work Saturdays and Sundays. And then we go to church three times a week. Okay. That's pretty much it. So you said he goes to work Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday? Yes. And this work, does he have support with him or does he work on his own? On his own. Okay, and how many total hours per week do you think he spends working? I think it's 20. 20, okay. And so now I'll ask about some school programs he's attended after high school. Is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in any academic program, vocational school, community college or university since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And so now I'd like to know a little bit more about his job. So you said he is currently working in the community independently. What is the name of the company or agency or business where he works? Cicis Pizza. Cicis Pizza. And can you describe his activity and what he does there? He's a buzzer, and he washes dishes and takes up the trash and things like that. And you mentioned earlier that he does this independently without supports while participating? Yes. And I imagine he's paid at this activity. Yes. I would hope so. And so how did he find this job? He just walked in and asked if they had job opening. Oh, that's great. Yes. And how many... Oh sorry, you said he does about 20 hours per week. Do you remember the month and year that he started? I think it was in August. August of? Last year. 2020? Yes. And do you think it's been a good fit for his skills and interests? Yes. He's loving working, making money. Oh, that's great. So what makes it a good fit for him? I think the job is pretty simple. It's things that he does at home and I think sometimes it's fast-paced, but for the most part it's slow-paced and he can take his time. It's things that he already knows how to do, and he doesn't really... That's great. And do you have any additional comments about his job here? No. Okay. And is he currently working at any other job or has he worked at any other job since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And so now we'll switch gears again and we will discuss...\n",
            "finishYou mentioned that he is no longer in high school. Did he exit the school system since the last time we spoke in February? No, it was before that. He has exited since the launch of the program, but not since February. He's been in college since then. Okay. And so for this section, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's attended since the last time we spoke in February. So what does a typical week look like for him? How has he been spending his time? Well, if we set aside the summer travel, I think he had class four days a week. So he would get out of bed a little bit later than I'd like him to, but by 9:00 or 10:00, take care of his own food needs and make sure he had breakfast. Then he would generally Skype into class. He would have a physical lab or learning experience every other week. So half the time he's going in on Skype, half the time he was driving to campus, come home shortly after lunch, make himself something to eat and then spend the day in leisure either with music or talking to his friends or playing video games. Okay. And so how many hours a week do you believe he spends participating in school related activities? Probably 10 to 12, a typical week. Okay. All, and so now I'd like to know a little bit more about his school program. So what is the name of his program or college? Columbia State Community College. Okay. Where he goes, he was in a certificate program, but this semester changed to an associate's program. Oh, great. He actually kind of upgraded. And okay. So was in certificate program. Okay. And so can you tell me a little bit more about this program? So the certificate program was in film and sound technology. So he would study and go to campus and have experiences around filmmaking, the process they're in setting up movie shoots, handling cameras, building track. Oh, that's so exciting. And kind of having the planning element to it and also the technical side. So he'll finish that up. And he decided that under with our council, not just leave the certificate program, but then transition to a broader associates and liberal studies I think is what the new programs called. Okay. And you said that his area of study was liberal studies? It's yeah. Associates degree and whatever the most generic term is, but I'm not sure what the actual title of it is, but... Like Liberal Arts? There you go. That sounds good. Okay. In liberal arts. Okay. And I imagine this is not an autism or disability specific program? Correct. Okay. And what is the average number of classes he takes per semester? I think it would've been three or four. They don't go on semesters. They do smaller, like broken down studies. So I think I'll go with four. It would be the usual number. Okay. And I imagine he's a full-time student then? Yes. And do you remember the month and year he started this program? Would've been September a year ago. So September 2020. Okay. And is he currently receiving supports from the program? Nothing specific to his autism. Okay. And are these supports available, but he's not using them or he doesn't need them? They don't really exist for the program that he was doing because it is a hands on learning experience. So, some of the distance learning and things like that were baked in and offered for the broader group, but they really didn't exist for the program that he chose to do. And so do you think if they did exist that they would be needed or are they needed, but, or, or not currently needed? I don't think they're currently needed for that. Okay. And, and do you feel that this program has been a good fit for him? Yes, ma'am. Great. And what makes it a good fit for him? It's the staff, but the school's been very accommodating. They've worked hard to connect him and he's had a built in peer group. I think also it's connected him with opportunities to volunteer and have some real world experience in what he was studying. So the balance of built in peer networking and then real world application of what he's studied, I think has been great. That's great. And do you have any additional comments about this program? No, ma'am. Okay. And has he been enrolled in any other programs since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And so is he currently participating in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities Or has he been... He still volunteers when available with the Nashville Steam Preservation Society... Oh, great. That's very rare because they're, it's been challenging and then he works at the house for us. So he, he actually does babysitting for his little brother and sister. Oh, great. And so with the Nashville Preservation Society, you said that is something that is current, even if it's not available too often? Technically, yes. Okay. And you said Nashville preservation society... Nashville Steam Preservation. Oh yeah. I remember him talking about this last year. It sounded really exciting. And so can you describe this activity? So in a limited sense, he would, he would do restoration work in a more practical sense. He kind of served as a docent to tell people about the train's history and what they're going to try to do and how special it was. So he would, he would actually interact with people who had questions about the train and what was going on. Okay. And does he receive supports while participating? No. Ma'am. And is he paid at this activity? Nope. And how did he find this? Well, he just, he, he really loves trains and I think this sort of happened across the train in Centennial park there on west end. And it kind of developed from there in terms of seeing a sign for the project and just sort of met guy there one day and they were off and running. Oh, that's great. And how many hours does he participate per week? Would you imagine? Or just how many hours like at a time? So general he would go for two or three hours, but in the last year, because of COVID, there really hasn't been much. So, I mean, it would be, it would be less than one hour a week, but it would come in like three hour bunches when it does happen. Okay. And do you remember the month and year he started this? It was probably five years ago. So I... unfortunately I don't. Okay. So about five years ago. Do you have... and if you don't remember, that's completely fine. Do you happen to remember around the time of year it may have been? It would've been Spring. Spring? We can... Do think that... ...That we could go to the park before it gets to... Do you think that maybe April would be a good guess? April sounds great. I think it was April. Okay, great. We'll say it was April of about 2016. And do you think that this has been a good fit for his skills and interests? For his interest, absolutely. He's very... With individual autism, what they love, they love absolutely. And he just... this is the very center of his interest. That's great. And do you have any other comment about this volunteering experience? No. Other than that, it's been, been a great growing experience for him, just in terms of exposure to people and folks being kind when they have those sort of common overlapped interests. That's great. And okay. And has he participated in any other sort of employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke? He did, he babysit his brother and sister at the house. Okay. And babysitting at the house. And about how many hours a week does he do that? Oh, probably 30. Oh, wow. Yeah. He's making banks. Let me tell you. Oh, that's great. Okay. And one moment, and then we'll continue to talk about his goals.\n",
            "finishI just wanted to ask you about your college, that you're going to. Do you think that this college is a good fit for you? So far, yes. I can't really think, I can't really think for sure yet, but I like it so far. That's great. And what's made it a good fit so far? Well, It's actually a little hard to explain. And I know it's very new, so if you don't have anything specific, then that's completely fine too. Yeah. I can't really explain why. It just kind of feels right right now. Well, that's great that it feels right. I'm really glad to hear that. And is there anything I else that you would like to tell me about your college experience? Well, it's a lot different from what I've had in the past. I mean, I have struggled with schooling in the past. That ever since I left my middle, after I left my middle... elementary, middle school. I had elementary and middle school in school. So ever since I left the first school after your seventh grade, I've just been struggling. And so the fact of having like a peace of mind and having like the sense of happiness in a way, is just kind of an alien to me because it's just been so long since I felt this way. Well, I'm so glad to hear that it's a great fit. That's really wonderful to hear. And so now we'll move on.\n",
            "finishAnd so now we'll, we'll shift gears a little bit. Okay. Talk about some activities that she's currently involved in. So she is still in high school. And has she ever worked during high school, but she did volunteer. You said. Well, yeah, when she was in girl scout, she did volunteer with the... but that was a long time ago. So, that wasn't during high school That was not during high school. And she volunteers now at the library right through her high school?  Right. But it's through her work based program, it's actually a class she gets credit for, but it is volunteering. And they had her also at East Park Community Center. She does some cleaning there and it's a little mom and pop hardware store that I don't remember the name. Somewhere over in East Nashville. She stocked things there that they call it the work based learning program. But it's sort of, well, I guess with the hardware store in the East Park, it wouldn't have been volunteering, but she can get the same volunteer job she's doing now for work-based learning at the library. Okay. Great. Well that sounds like a great program. Mm-hmm   Perfect. Well, that one was a short one.\n",
            "finish... be talking about some activities that he may be involved in. Okay. Gosh, I feel like I'm not doing anything when I talk to you. Oh no, you . You just don't know all we've done. Yeah, it's fine. Also, I was really impressed at how much you knew about those too, because I know the service system is really confusing and you were very aware of all of those. Yeah, I am. That's why I just, yeah. And I know it's a lot to take in. It is. Yeah, I am his advocate and I have been his whole... I mean, I was a stay-at-home mom because of that. It seems like that. Yeah. Well, my degree was in education, so I had a degree in elementary ed. And so as far as the education system side of it was concerned, I was always able to then advocate for him in his IEPs and things like that. So, I think that's a lot of it. But then, like I said, he was in ABA therapy through the Children's Autism Center in Fort Wayne. He started in second grade and we had a full-time BCBA and aid. Yeah. And his BCBA wasn't with him at school full-time. But we had a BCBA that then oversaw an assistant that went to school with him full-time from second grade until eighth grade. So part of what we were doing is we were purposefully stepping back that support as he was moving into high school- To be more independent. Right, because we did want him to be independent. So being at Benthal, there's only 10 kids in his class. It's not like... he's able to function independently for a fact. So he's thinking for himself and gaining some of that self independence, which is really the goal of where we were anyway. So that's why we're not doing a lot of other stuff. But yeah. And has he ever worked during high school? No. And has he ever volunteered in the community during high school? Yes. And where did he volunteer? He's volunteered, well, he's only a sophomore, but he has volunteered at the Community Harvest Food Bank in Fort Wayne. And then he volunteered, this year, he's done some volunteer work through his high school. And I don't remember where they went, but it was a similar bank, a food bank. So he's done some food bank volunteer work. I mean, he's gone with us to help us volunteer at concession stands for his sister when she was in show choir, things like that. He's done a little bit of church volunteer work. Okay.\n",
            "finishOkay. So far. Yeah, you're doing great. And- I mean, I know this is- it's always kind of scary, you know? Because you just have to open up so much about your personal life. Oh, of course.  And if there's ever a time that you'd like don't want to discuss something or if you'd need to take a break, feel free at any point to let me know. We definitely don't want to like make you feel like you need to open up too much about things you're not comfortable discussing. Oh no, no, I appreciate it. And it's fine. You're just in the back of your mind as you're talking, you're just like, oh, are you doing enough? It's just always that, but anyway, go ahead. Let's keep moving. Okay. And so you said he, he is currently in high school. So is he currently working? He is not currently working. And this is just something that we ask of everybody. So why is he not working at this time? I would say he is not working at this time just because we are still exploring some job opportunities for him and just sort of working on pre-employment skills. But we have a goal of having him have some kind of a part-time job, I would say hopefully within the next year. So I mean, that's just the only reason he's not working is because we haven't encouraged him to really work yet. And- Yeah. And has he worked and left any jobs since we last spoke with you in January? No. And what about volunteering in the community? Hee is not currently volunteering in the community. He will be doing some volunteer work with this camp that he's doing. And then again, I'm really planning to start having him volunteer in the community, probably just when we get back into the school routine. Mm-hmm  Great. And it hadn't been my goal. Originally, I had planned last year I had planned that we were going to be volunteering in the community during the summer and just getting started with that. But again with COVID I held back and then I have been looking a little bit for some volunteer opportunities for him here just recently. I've been doing a little bit of research with that because I have seen that the state of Tennessee, part of like when you're graduating from high school for the Tennessee promise you have to have like a certain number of hours to qualify for the Tennessee promise. But then there's also a diploma that's called the Tennessee scholars. And with the Tennessee scholars diploma, you have to have had 80 hours of documented volunteer work. And so he's already met every single other requirement of that. And so all he needs is the volunteer work. So I definitely am going to get him out and volunteering. And that would be one reason too, why he might not actually get employed is because I'm probably going to start out and have him work as a volunteer for a little while and then use that volunteer work to kind of segue him into a job-job, if that makes sense. Yeah, that sounds great. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to use that as like a training opportunity and really, I just have to get motivated myself to get out there and do this. Of course It's been a very busy summer. Oh, I imagine Time really. No, that sounds like a great plan. And so now we'll transition.\n",
            "finishQuestions. Okay. And so just to confirm, you mentioned that she is out of high school. And, Yes. And so what does a typical week look like for Shannon? How has she been spending her time? Well, currently she, she is working she's on lane. She has two jobs. So she's on lane during the summer from the Metro, from a school job. And she currently works five days a week and a food service job and is going through training for that. She also volunteers at the a local church for vacation Bible school and those types of things. She volunteers at the Y still for summer camp for some classes. And she goes out with reach up with people that she's met through, or sometimes for some, a bite to eat or just to hang out and it's pretty much it, she keeps her day filled. It sounds like it, she sounds very busy, which is great. And so you mentioned that she has two jobs and she also volunteers. And so how many hours per week do you think she spends volunteering and working? Oh, and working, I would say between 50 and 55, maybe. Okay. And is she currently enrolled or has she been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school community college or college? Since the last time we spoke with you in March? Not since the last time no, No. Okay. And so now I'd love to hear about these jobs that you mentioned. So you mentioned she just started a job. And is she working with support or is she working independently? Well, I believe this week she'll be working independently. She had a week and a half of training with support. So now she will be on a trial basis to work independently. Okay. Okay. And what is the name of the company that she's working for? She's working for a hospital. For a medical center. Okay. And what does she do there? She provided, she works in the food service. She helps deliver food to various patients or employees that work for the medical center. That's great. And you mentioned that she was receiving supports, but now she's going to transfer to working independently. Well, typical support because she was being trained for the position. Oh, okay. So now she will work independently. And yet of course we'll be on a trial basis to make sure that she's able to fact perform that of the job without assistance. And these are she's was receiving typical supports and not like extra supports at work, correct? No, no, no extra support. No. Oh wow. Not at this time. And I imagine she's paid at this activity. Yes she is. Great. And how did she find this job? She sought a job. And, and how many hours per week does she work here? She will be working 40 a week. And what month and year did she start? July. Just okay 21. Okay. And do you think so far it's been a good fit for her skills interests So far? Yes. And what ma what has made it a good fit? It's an environment that she is pleased to work and she's able to have some contact with people have kind of a social aspect to it without being committed, to keeping up extended conversations or that. So she can still work with people without, I think a lot of stress or, it's easier for her than holding a normal social conversation with someone where she can just briefly interact with the different people that she comes in contact with at work. Okay. And it's repetitive. So she's able to can you know, to able to perform, to do research necessary as a repetitive service. Great. And so also mentioned that she is working another job at Metro. Yeah. She works at school bus aid during the school year. Okay. And what does she do as a school bus aid? Well, it back then varies to some degree. She works usually with the children with physical disabilities. So she helps to make sure that they're strapped into their seatbelts and are safe for the ride. And when she's not with the children that are disabled, she's usually she kind of monitors that the children are trying to keep them seated or remind them to stay seated on the bus. That's great. And how many hours does she generally work per week there? There typically 25 maybe. And I imagine she's paid at this activity. Yes. And has it been a good fit for her skills and interests Overall? Yes. Yes. Sometimes it'll stressful for her, but, but overall, I think she's been fine with it. And what makes it a good fit? Well, again, she, she enjoy working with children. It's competitive, or I'm repetitive. I'm sorry. The only time she seems a little stressed is when she has to work on the buses that have the older children who perhaps aren't as willing to be told or to be reminded to, their behaviors and that, but overall, it's something that she enjoys doing. That's great. And you mentioned that she is involved in some volunteering activities and that she's currently involved in two, one at church and one at the YMCA. Correct. And which one did she start most recently? Well, she's been doing both for, for several years. Okay. So then either one that you would like to discuss first, do you have a preference for which one we discussed first? No. Okay so we can, The Y she's, YMCA. And what does she do there? She assists with the summer camp activities helps direct some of the craft activities during swim time or swim lessons. She assists with the swim coaches and children. And how many hours per week does she participate in this volunteering? Probably five, five hours a week. And is she paid at this activity? No. And has it been a good, been a good fit for her skills and interests? Yes. She's an average swimmer. And, and again, she's social as well as a good fit otherwise. And what has may it a good fit for her? She's an averaged swimmer. So it's something that she's already, she does have the skills that she understands and can convey to others. And, and if so, she loves working with children and there's a children centric activity. That's great. And so now we can discuss volunteering at church. Was there anything that you wanted to let us know about what she did us there or about whether it's a good fit for her? Not really. It's basically the same thing. She works with children just going the younger first through third graders helps with the craft activities or helps them to learn their prayers if she's working during the school year. And, and there's it. And she just enjoys doing that. And there's something that's familiar with. Great. And, Okay. And so now we'll switch gears one more time to the last part of this. And we'll talk about the goals that we set about a year ago.\n",
            "finishServices that he might be... Sorry. Some activities he might be involved in. And so you mentioned he is still receiving services through the school system. Is he currently working? He is not. Okay. And this is just something that we ask of everyone, but why is he not currently working? Well, the only employment that he's had has been, he participated in Goodwill program in the summer. And so they have not had that for the past couple of summers. He would love to be working. I want him to go ahead and finish all of his school program before he does that. And my ambition is for him to either finish here or finish in North Carolina, but I really hope he gets over in North Carolina to get into a similar thing before he ages out, so that he can get placed through that program. In the program in Tennessee, it does happen sometimes, that some of the places where they work, will end up hiring the student. And I've just had a few  conversations with the North Carolina school system, and I think that they work in the same way. So I'm hoping for him to get placed in that way. Yeah. That would be great. And just to confirm, has he worked and left any jobs since the last time we spoke in January of this year? No. And what about volunteering in the community since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And so now we will talk about the goals that we-\n",
            "finish... activities that she's involved in, and so I know we kind of covered this a little bit, but just wanted to ask about it to double-check. Is she currently working? No. No. And this is just something that we ask of everybody, why is she not currently working? Many reasons. She's a teenager, there's COVID out there. Mm-hmm , of course. I mean, those two alone is enough. Definitely. I can stop there. Okay. And has she worked and left any jobs since the last time we spoke in January? No. No. She's never been employed. Yeah, I imagined not, just double-checking. And has she volunteered in the community during high school since the last time we spoke? Again, no. Okay. COVID. Due to COVID? Of course.\n",
            "finishOkay, so when we very first met, we set three annual goals with you and the purpose of this was to help you think about the goals that you like and really start working on them. So since about a year has passed, we would like to know about how you have been doing with these goals. But before we continue to discussing progress, we do feel it's important to say that we understand that a lot can happen in a year. And this past year was especially unpredictable, and we know that COVID might have impacted goals too, and made it harder. Yeah. So we understand that. Mm-hmm . Okay, so the first goal was, once a week you take notes after your social skills class about what you've learned, with the focus of this goal being how often you take notes after your social skills class. So over the last year, how have you been doing with this goal? The goal of social skills has been improving upon social skills, but I wouldn't say that I have been improving as much as I would if it was in person. Mm-hmm . But I have been improving in a small amount. Mm-hmm . But I still feel like it will be a drop in the bucket when it comes to just going to college, because we make a lot of friends in college. Mm-hmm . I feel like social skills have been improved when I went to college. Mm-hmm  and so have you still been able, I know that you not been able to go to the class in person, but have you still been able to go to the classes online? I see. The classes as in the English class, and the mosaic class, or? The social skills class. Oh I see, so you mean the mosaic class. I think so, I think I remember your mom was saying that you used to take a social skills class, once a week? Are you referring to TNSA?  Or are you referring to-. I think that's the one. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, TNSA got canceled. Oh, no. When did it get canceled if you remember? Before summer. Oh, okay. So a few months ago? No, before summer it's more than a few months ago. Oh, okay. Like summer of this year? Yes. Okay. Okay, so before summer of this year. So before it got canceled, were you still able to go like online, or? I mean, I don't see why I couldn't have gotten online. Or, were you still going before it got canceled? Yes. Yes, okay. When you were still going before it got canceled, how often were you taking notes about what you learned? Well, taking notes is not really something that we did a lot of in a class like physical notes and I mean we did take some notes when we're asked to. This was before I was this really college student, or before I graduated high school. Mm-hmm . So this is quite a while ago. Mm-hmm . We didn't take a lot of notes back then and it wasn't that major. Okay. Okay, so it sounds like with the goal of taking notes after this class, that you didn't get to work a lot on that. And I was just wondering if there were any barriers that you encountered for working on this goal? Yes, COVID. But after COVID significantly declined, I graduated high school. So it was actually before it significantly declined I think, It was around the same time, but I was just too busy coming here to try . Mm-hmm . Okay. And so the next goal was that you come up with a list of five questions, comments, or concerns that you would like to discuss with disability offices at colleges that you're interested in with the focus of that being the number of questions, comments, or concerns that are on your list. And so I know you mentioned that you were taking some classes now. So I was wondering how you've been doing with this goal? Or how this goal went? Well, Let me think about that. I'd say that I've been more productive-. Mm-hmm . ... but again, I still have some work in progress for productivity. Again, it helps, but I still have work in progress, but this is probably the most help that I've gotten in a long time, because it's my first time in college, so. Mm-hmm . Okay. And just to make sure I got that right. You said it's probably the most help you've gotten in a long time? Uh-huh . Well, that's great that you're getting that help. That sounds like a really good opportunity. And so-. Yeah, but college is a lot of hard work so, isn't being the most help I've gotten a long time. Isn't enough to target past college just by itself, which is why I'm getting additional help through just college in general. And I go see the UTCs, They're accepting me and they're putting me into the program and it's going to help me. Yeah, that's great. Mm-hmm . Good. Yeah, that sounds like a really great program from what you were saying earlier. And so you mentioned that you are going to be getting some help through them and some support. And so do you have an idea or an estimate of how many questions or comments or concerns that you have written down to talk to them about, or that you just talked to them about when you met with them at any point? Like when you were talking to them about different types of help that you could get? Yeah. A little about that. Yeah. Do you happen to remember how many points you brought up to them, or how many questions or comments you brought up to them? I've been a part of the group discussion and I've been getting better at being a part of the discussion than I used to in the early days of DC, so zoom meetings that we've been attending. So, that's something I've improved upon and I did enter stuff into the chat and ask questions and I had sometimes. And, again, I'm still not to my fullest potential at asking questions but I need them, but I would've been getting better. I'd say I've mostly been getting help from paying attention when it comes to this matter. And paying attention is kind of, gotten best at. Well, maybe not the best have like in general, but when it comes to just-. What we're talking about done yet? Well, that's really great to hear that you're getting better about asking for help when you need it. I know that's something that can be really hard to do. So that's great. Yeah. And you mentioned in these meetings that you were typing question in the chat and stuff like that. Yeah. If you had to guess the number of questions that you asked in the chat, do you have an estimate? A certain number of questions I asked in the chat are like, or which whenever she asks us to type something in the chat then she would sometimes ask us about the chat and she would ask us to type something in the chat, like to answer to a question. And then I'd probably be the first to type it into the chat. Mm-hmm . This is how I do I'm the first, but well at least in recent years, I mean, it's one thing I'm getting better at. And is this-. Let me summarize this in general. Like I'm getting better. Mm-hmm . And are you speaking about your English class or is this when you're talking to the disability offices at your college? If you remember? So the disability office is, Mm-hmm . Yeah. Have you been speaking with them about help that you might need or questions you might have or things like that? I did not. Like yeah, but not that often, but yes. Okay. Okay. So you've been speaking with them, you said not too often, but you have been speaking with them? Yep. And if you just had to guess how many questions or comments you've brought up to them before? How many would you guess that you've brought up to them? I'd say like once every time we meet, once or twice. Okay. Probably once. And how many times do you think you've met with them so far? If you just had to guess? Like ever? Yes. Three to five times, probably, but I'm not sure. Okay. Three to five times. And you ask a question about once. Okay. Great. Well, that sounds really good. Okay. Okay. And so then the next one is that once a week, you'll initiate conversation with classmates at school, with the focus of this one being how often you initiate conversations with classmates. And I know that you're not in school anymore, so that's completely fine. But if you can remember back to when you were in school, how often do you think you were initiating conversations with classmates? I'd say I wasn't doing it that often. I'd say that I wasn't really good at starting conversations in school. I was probably better at starting conversations elsewhere and social skills groups, but in school just wasn't really good, but I didn't really know how to . Mm-hmm . Okay. It's just not really made for socializing and it's not really-. Mm-hmm . The thing that's hard about making friends in school is that, well you're not supposed to talk during class. Yeah. Yeah that can definitely make it more challenging to find an opportunity to start a conversation then. Yeah. So even nowadays, I don't really understand, I mean, I understand how it's possible, but I don't know how to make friends in high school, but I think I could do it in college if there's more opportunities for me to do so. Mm-hmm . Okay. Well, that's exciting to think about making friends in college. It definitely does sound like it would be a really good environment for that compared to high school. And you haven't started in person quite yet at college, right? Yeah. That's upcoming? Okay. And so just, if you had to guess, I know that you said it wasn't too often, but if you had to just guess when you were in high school, how often you started the conversation with classmates, how often when you were doing your best, do you think that you started conversations with classmates? I guess, you mean like in college starting conversations or just-. Oh, it could be in college too, if you've had opportunities to do that. Yeah. Whenever you were, over the last year, when you were doing your best with starting conversations with people like classmates, how often do you think you were starting those conversations? I think I'm not starting conversations that much right now, but when I'm in an area with a lot of other people and I'm allowed to talk to them, like it's easier for me to socialize and college has a lot of opportunities for that. I can socialize when I'm in like a party or something. I socialized a party before. That's great. So over the last year, when you were doing your best with socializing and this doesn't actually have to just be classmates at school, this could be socializing in general with friends or even outside of a school setting. When you were doing your best, how often do you think that you were the one starting the conversation? Pretty often, I'd say. And do you have an estimate, like once a month? Twice a month? Once a week? Does my family count or does it not count? I think with this one, we'd really focus on starting conversations with friends outside of the family. Well, with new people I'd say that it's been happening like once a month, I guess, because I'm not really into,  and I'm not into social stuff, but I'm getting more into social stuff as I grow older, but in general, I'm not really experiencing a lot this summer, but I'll be experiencing a lot more social stuff in the fall and I have high hopes that I'll be able to become a more social person in college. Mm-hmm . Yeah, definitely. I think that college is going to be a really great environment for that, for sure. And that's really exciting that you'll be starting that. And so, it sounds like you've been starting conversations with people outside the family about once a month. And so I was wondering, have there been any barriers to working on this goal? You kind of talked about a few, but just wanted to see if there was anything else that you wanted to say about any barriers for this one. Or if there was anything that made it harder to do it more often than once a month? I mean, I guess now that I'm seeing  this much, being around people makes me feel more extroverted, and being by myself makes me feel more introverted now that I'm really thinking about it. And I would've never thought about that beforehand, but yep. Oh, okay. Okay, but being around people makes you feel extroverted and being not around people makes you feel more introverted? No it doesn't make me feel extroverted it just makes me feel more , still moderately introverted, But I still talk to other people. Mm-hmm . So you said being around other people makes you feel moderately introverted, but you still like being around other people? Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. Great. And thank you so much for answering all my questions about the goals that was really helpful. And it's great to hear that you've been working on some stuff and that it'll be really exciting when you start calling.\n",
            "finishTo confirm she is not still in high school. No, she's graduated. And she graduated quite a while ago? Okay. Yes. So what does a typical week look like for her? How has she been spending her time? Well, with the COVID her schedule has changed where she's awake at night and sleep during the day, because her nephews do homeschool during the day and need the internet. So a lot of her leisure time is online gaming, so she changed her sleep schedule. So basically she plays on the computer, I guess. Okay. And so is she currently enrolled, or has she been enrolled in any academic program or community college or university, since the last time we spoke in February? She has not. And what about... Oh, sorry. She hopes to in the future, but she's not at the moment. Okay. Okay. And is she currently participating in or has she participated in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke in February? No. No, she is not. Okay.

So he just finished the extended school year, so the summer school program and he was receiving speech and special education services through that. And will he continue to receive services through the school system in the fall as well? Yes. Okay. Is that's what the job program is through? Yes. Oh, great. And is he currently working? No. And this is just something that we ask everybody. Why is he not currently working? He's just not able to. So that's really good that he'll be starting that job program. And this is also something that we just ask of everyone. Has he worked and left any jobs since we last spoke in February? No. And what about volunteering in the community? No. Okay. And-\n",
            "finishHigh school employment, if they was ever involved in any type of high school employment, and then after high school, what happened there, and what be did. So first about high school, is, did she ever work in high school? No. Even informally? And what about, sorry? Well, we, I homeschooled them. Yes. Oh, okay. So... So, we did volunteer work in Chicago. So one trip that we went on was we did a school painting day, where they went in the summer and so they helped paint the classrooms for the next school year. So she, she did that as much as she could at that age, but she did. And then we went for the Chicago literacy. It was like a library, they were moving buildings. And so we volunteered to help pack. That is as close to work as she's ever done. No, that's great. Cause I always have my next... I was volunteering during high school. But that was part of what I made them do is we had to go and help out. Yeah. That's awesome. I'm sure that was fun for them at the time. Right. And I guess if I had done, I could think I probably should have looked for more volunteer work with peers their age, as opposed to everywhere that we'd done something it was adults. And they interact well with adults, so I never really... You know, she wasn't diagnosed until 21. So... I mean, they were fine. She helped, they, she boxed up books. She talked with the adults, like everything was fine. I mean, she didn't, but I didn't know anything about autism at the time either, so... Yeah. And I think that's the case for a lot of especially bright girls who maybe this symptoms are more mild, they don't look the same, that they could go under the radar, because it's not that significant that they cannot really function in life and... Right, right, and then it was like, okay, you're 18. And you don't want to drive. 16, I was okay because I didn't want to pay that. But at 18 I was like, really? You don't want to work? I mean, when I was 18, I'm like... Yeah. Actually when I was 16, I pretty much, but you know, it's like, I don't... That's whenever it first started, like okay, somethings not right here... I, yeah. But at that point they were... she did the schoolwork, she did her work. It was very one-on-one. So I thought that maybe there was some type of learning disability, but I think it was more of a focus. If it wasn't something that was really caught her interest, unless you were right there, she's not doing it. She's doing what interests her, which was Neopets or something at the time. I don't know... So, what does a typical week look like for  now? Right now? Well, since they stopped going to that, they... Maybe on Saturday, I might talk them into going to the store with me. Other than that, they're at home. She's at home in her room. Okay. Reclusive, basically. And that's by own choice. I'm assuming... Trying to, yeah. Trying to get her to do more. And I really think they need to be separated. Yes. Well, it's also like, yes, that probably fits into not wanting to get out of... Yes. At least there's someone else. Yes. Has she ever been enrolled in an academic or educational program? No. No. And that's any type of academic program after high school? Nothing. Nothing. Okay. And what about employment after high school? She applied for a job once and went to an interview at Cracker Barrel. Okay. And they never called her back, so... Okay. She was done. Yeah. That's disappointing that they didn't call and I mean, not even to say \"no\". Right. Nothing, no call. I think  called and asked them about it and they couldn't find a record of it, either of them. That's... yeah. Okay, so that's the last question for these . We can probably switch now. Yes. And I'll have you do one survey and then Jordan will come here. I'll be...\n",
            "finishIs this residential? It's a high school program? Yes. Okay. And you mentioned that earlier, he's not currently working, correct? Correct. And this is just something that we ask to all participants. Why is he not currently working? Where do I start? He is in a residential program, they don't offer the kids employment during the school program. That would be one factor. And then the other factor is he just doesn't probably have the ability to stay on task for any period of time due to his emotional cognitive impairments. Thank you so much for expanding on that. And has he volunteered in the community during high school Since the last time we spoke? And I know that he's probably been very secluded because of COVID. And you mentioned that people during COVID at his school weren't really able to leave campus. But I just wanted to double check if he's volunteered in the community since? No. Okay. And so now we switch gears again, we'll talk about-\n",

I believe I moved back home since last time or . I'm not sure. Mm-hmm . I think I was living on campus last time. I'm currently back at home, and so now there's two of us. Oh, got it. Mm-hmm . Okay. And then also, you mention that you're not really running a lot now, but at your best over the last year, it was about between one and two weeks. And so I was just wondering if there was anything that made keeping up with that one maybe more challenging to keep up with? I guess not necessarily. Mm-hmm . I'm not sure about right, right now. I haven't been able... it is pretty hot out right now. Oh, definitely. For the most part, I believe. Mm-hmm . Well, thank you so much for calling back and answering those for me. I really appreciate it. And for telling me more about those.\n",
            "finishSo, I'll get this going. And then let's see if this is going. It should be now. Okay, perfect. So first, your mom and I talked about your school and some of the programs that you've been to, and some of the jobs that you've had. So we'll talk about just very briefly, your thoughts on those. And then we also talked about some goals you might be interested in working on in the coming year. So, we'll talk about those as well. Let's see, I think I have some forms for you as well. Let me just double check. Yeah, if you could fill out the information, please. I think most of it is filled out for both and I'll pull up what we're going to be working on.  I guess, was there anything else besides my signature? Let me see, I think we're good to go. Oh, if you could just sign and date this one. Thank you.  Thank you so much. Okay, so first your mom was to telling me about your current university, Marshall. And I wanted to just ask you, do you think that this program is a good fit? Yeah. Okay, great. And so what makes it a good fit? Let's see. So, they make it a lot easier to communicate with my instructors. They're a little bit more, they're a little bit more involved, which helps me stay on track... Yeah, that sounds great. Is there anything else about the program that you like especially? Not a specific thing off the top of my head. Okay yeah, no problem. And do you have any additional comments about this program? Or if not, we can move on to the next one. My only other comment would be, it's expensive. Okay. Yeah, I'm sure. Didn't need it, I wouldn't use. So it sounds like that's the only downside. Yeah. And you know, it's out of state, so yeah. And so the other one that she was telling me about was the online one that you tried. And was this one a good fit? The online? So, so the online class I took, or? Or the, I think it, did she say it was ball state university online classes. Vol State. Oh, Vol State. Sorry, I misspelled. Do you mind spelling that for me? V-O-L, short for Volunteer State. Yeah. Oh, okay. Makes sense. So, was this one a good fit, do you think? It may have been, it may have been better if I had gone to the, like physical classes at the school itself, but the school was too far away. Taking online class didn't go over so well. Yeah, so I'll put probably not the best fit. And so what were your reasons for stopping this program or leaving? Well, let's see... So the, as in Vol State? Well, I wanted to take physical classes. They seem to work better and they're less expensive. Course, they're not that, they're not less expensive when they're out of state. But- Yeah. The only reason I was at Vol State in the first place was because I had been suspended from my previous two schools for grades. So, would you say that you chose to leave this program? Mm-hmm . Okay. So we're, now we're going to talk about the other two schools. So, Nashville State, do you think this one was a good fit? Mm-hmm . Yeah. Yeah, and why do you feel that way? The... My advisor, who's also my professor at the same time, was really helpful. Yeah, I think your mom mentioned that she was really nice. Yeah, just generally everyone there, I think was as helpful as they could be. Yeah. And I was wondering if you felt comfortable describing the circumstances of your departure from there? You mentioned that it had something to do with grades. So, I had, I kind of had just been failing a ton of classes and so by the time I got into Nashville State, I already had a pretty low GPA. So, after that I got, I did get calculus, my calculus one grade there. Went and moved on calculus two, but I failed that, so- That's a hard one. I'm very bad at calculus myself. So, I'm understandable. Can be derivatives and that's about it. Do you have any additional comments about this program or we can move on to the next one? Let's see, when I joined, yeah I guess when I joined National State, I originally did that. We ended going back to Tennessee Tech. So, when I signed up for my degree there, like it was originally meant to be aligned with Tech's requirements, and then I like changed to a physics degree from State. It was weird. Yeah, so maybe change Academic track. Well, it was physics the whole time, but it was like, I don't know how to put this. Like maybe the requirement, the courses you took were a bit different from the requirements at Tennessee Tech? Or what courses I took when, yeah. Okay, now we can talk about Tennessee Tech. So, do you feel that this program was a good fit? I like the place, I had a lot of friends there, but having gone to a few different schools now, it's probably not the best option. Yeah, and why do you feel that way? A large part of it was the disability program was kind of hard to work with. Yeah, that sounds really inconvenient. And can you think of maybe reasons they were hard to work with, or examples? Well, I guess something else I should point out is that Nashville State is easy to get to and Tennessee Tech isn't, and so it's harder to relay information to my parents or at this point, just my mom, I guess. When we can't just all three be in a room and legally they can't just... Yeah. Get really that information to my mom themselves. Yeah. She was saying that she'd try to call and they wouldn't necessarily relay the information to you, which does sound really frustrating. And so you said that you left the program because of grades. Do you want, if you feel comfortable describing the circumstances or if not, that's also okay. It's, it's pretty much the same as it was at Nashville State. I failed a bunch of classes. Chemistry was the only one I didn't, but... That's impressive because chemistry's hard. I don't think it is, but oh well. Yeah, so eventually my GPA just reached a point where... That's right, also when I, when I entered Tennessee Tech, I already had kind of a low GPA. Not as low as it was when I left, but kind of a low GPA and got in on account of that my ACT scores were really high. Yeah. That's impressive too. I found the ACT to be harder than the SAT. Do you have any additional comments or we can move on to the next one? That's all. Okay, so then your mom was telling me about working at Battered and Fried. So do you feel that this job was a good fit? Yes. Great. And what made it a good fit? Well, it was kind of just my last job, but better. That's always. Yeah. And in what ways was it better? It's closer to home and not downtown. Oh yeah. Downtown sounds like a nightmare. The, the shifts end earlier, which means I am actually able to take the bus home and yeah. That sounds a lot more convenient. Yeah. And your mom said that you chose to leave. For school. Yeah, so I was going to ask about those circumstances, but it sounds like you wanted to focus on school. Yeah. Do you have any additional comments about this one or? Not really? My, my dad built the  Oh, that's cool. And the other job was at Bridgestone and was going to ask if that one was a good fit. I wouldn't go back. Yeah. Okay, that's probably not. I was wondering why it wasn't the best fit? Let's see... I felt like too impersonal kind of, like everyone was just there to do their job and then leave. The room was what? They'd do their job and leave. Yeah. And it sounds like it, location wise wasn't ideal either. Right. Were there any other reasons that it wasn't best fit? Well, I guess a lot of the, not a lot of the reason, but part of the reason I wouldn't go back is because I'm making more money for the same thing right now. But, also the hours were really late. It was like five or three to five o'clock down to like 11 o'clock to sometimes one in the morning. Which- Oh, that sounds like a lot. Well, like I'm personally fine with it, but it didn't line up very well with my mom's work hours. Yeah, I imagine. So, what was your reason for leaving this job? So, I had originally, I kept it at the same time that I started my, what do I call it? My current job. Started my job at Battered and Fried. I didn't really quite understand how the first jobs, like attendance thing, whatever you call it, worked. And so, I eventually got fired for not showing up, but that takes three work days, but it like in non-work days, it took months. Oh yeah. That's funny. And so, do you have any additional comments about this one? I guess that's one other thing is that it didn't actually have a lot of hours, even though it was a lot of hours per day. Oh yeah. Also, apparently though, it's gotten a lot better recently. Yeah. I have a friend who works events at Bridgestone and it just sounds really stressful. Anyway. It is. Okay. And so now that's done, let's see.\n",
            "finishAnd so just to confirm, he is still in high school. And I know that we've already addressed this, but I'm just double checking in case I missed anything. He's not currently working, correct? Correct. And this is something that we just ask all families. Why is he not currently working? I mean, he can't really, without some help. You know what I mean? Without help. Of course. And because of COVID, it shut down the school. But supposedly, it's supposed to open back up when he goes back to school. Mm-hmm . And I know that you said that it shut down due to COVID, but I just wanted to double check and make sure. Has he worked and left any jobs since we last spoke in January? No. And what about volunteering in the community? No. Okay. And so now I'll switch gears.\n",
            "finishOkay. And so is he still in high school or receiving any services through the school system? No. Okay. Did he exit the school system since the last time we spoke in January? No. Okay. So then for this section, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's been involved in since the last time we spoke in January. But first I'd like to get an idea of how he normally spends his time, so we'll talk about the activities he does in a typical week. So what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? He does a lot of his own research on the computer, just looking up things he's interested in. He loves looking up stuff about animals, both living and extinct. He spends time with his dog and cat. He spends time with me, his mom. We recently have been able to go visit family that we had not seen since the pandemic started. That's great. He likes looking at nature, the birds and stuff outside. That's great. Is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college or university since the last time we spoke? No. Has he been participating in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke in January? No. Okay. So now we'll switch gears again.\n",
            "finishSo. Sebastian is still in high school, correct? Correct. Okay. I mean, homeschool high school. Yes, yes. So he hasn't worked. Can you tell me a little bit about... I know you say he volunteers at the theater. Has he volunteered anywhere else? No, just theater stuff. Okay. Can you tell- You know. Sure, sure. And can you tell me the name of the theater? Uh-huh . Danville Light Opera. Great. And, you've mentioned it, but I just want to type it in here. Can you give me a rundown of the types of things that he does there when he volunteers? Well, he and his brother, presently, their job is hanging drywall. Oh, that's right. Yeah, and mudding the drywall, and sanding the drywall. Other stuff they've done, they've moved, transported props from one building to another building. They've torn down many sets. He's helped with his brother. His brother does actually does... He builds props, and masks, and that sort of stuff, so they've done a lot of that. Okay. I think Sebastian helps him do that kind of stuff. They're very interested in all things theater. That's really great. That's so cool. Okay. All right. And then-\n",
            "finish... recyclable things. Mm-hmm . Okay. They had a candy store that they worked at. Great. And this was through school. What kinds of supports did he have there when he was working the job? He had a job coach with him. That basically was a glorified special ed aid, who did not really coach him such as he would need help. And he couldn't find the coach, and the coach would be out having a smoke break. Okay. He wasn't around. No, but he knew enough to go look for him. Good. I mean, so there was- Okay. Things like that, that I realized it wasn't a good placement for him. And can you remember about when he started working at the hotel through the school? He did there two years. What year was it? What year did he start? 2015 to 2016. Great. Okay. Let's see. And did you think that this job was a good fit for Ivan's skills and interests? No. Can you tell me a little bit why not? Because he wasn't trained well. At the hotels, he also would fold towels. Mm-hmm . He soon figured out that when his supervisor wasn't there, he didn't have to work. Okay. And so when he saw the supervisor, then he quickly would go back to work. He figured that all on his own. Were there a lot of times where he wasn't working then as a result? Yeah, I'm sure there are. My husband actually, Ivan's stepdad used to work in the hotel industry and had some special needs people, so he knew exactly what they were doing. Yes. And we offered one time, we let him go and he can share how to wash windows and how to fold towels. And he knew the exact fold that he was doing and stuff like that, which most parents don't know. Yeah. No, I wouldn't know that. Yeah. Okay. And did he volunteer at all in the community during high school? Because he wasn't CPS, he had to have the thing, and he ended up volunteering at our church in the library to get his community service hours in. Yeah. Okay. And what did he do at the library? Well,  customers, got the request, what materials they needed and he would give them to them. Okay, great. Now for the rest of this, we're going to talk about life after high school. So he's been out of high school for a while, and I'd like to get an idea of how he typically spends his time during a typical week. Can you give me a rundown of what a week looks like, and we can talk about before COVID I suppose because everything is weird now. So, what was he doing? We talk about COVID crush your being creative . Yeah. Crusher in creativeness. Ivan used to work out with me three times a week. We would go to a gym. He would also have a PSW with him while he worked out on the main floor and walk the track because Ivan has a hard time with social distancing and was appropriate. And to make sure that he's going the right way, so his PSW had to be right there with him. Okay. If he went swimming with me, he was fine. But the PSW though would make sure when he went to the locker room, that things were kosher. Okay. Yeah. Ivan has to be constantly supervised. Okay. Because he well did himself. He doesn't understand. I was sharing with your colleague just last week. We went to the dentist and after the dentist, we were going out to the car, and he wanted to get into the car backseat behind the driver's side. But there was a bus pulling up. He hid by the bus. He did get hit? No. Oh. The bus driver and I, we both caught it and  forever, but he just forgets. Okay. And when he isn't working out with you in the PSW, has he gone to any community programs or does he work?  like him. They're too loud. If he's gone into some special rec programs, they're way too loud. The other clients drive them crazy because they invade space. They don't leave them alone. That was not a good fit at all, programs that we have checked out. We've gone to various personal programs and most of them have been basically glorified babysitting. And we're not going to do that to him. Okay. When we've asked to see some of the programs, they've said, \"Oh, well, you can't.\" I said, \"Well, just show me one way mirror. They said, \"Oh no, we have to keep the doors locked.\" And it's like, \"Then you can't see what's going on. I'm not putting you in there.\" That's scary. Originally, when we moved out here to Elmhurst, there was a program right here in Hillside that we thought would be good, but it wasn't. It looked great on paper. But when you go there and too many people are looking for a babysitter, not for a program that teaches. Ivan has come so far since he's left high school, his caring for others. Mm-hmm . Yesterday, I instructed him. I says, \"Take this half a soup and share it with your brother.\" He very carefully divided the portion and brought it over to his brother. And he got upset when his brother didn't take it. But you're not going to learn that. Because of his noise sensitivity, that's why, and his sensory things, we haven't found the individual program, which we finally have called... We said to Ivan, \"Yes, you are in a program. You're in mom's school program.\" Yeah. And I said, \"That is a program. You're learning life skills. You're learning how to do this.\" \"Oh, that's a program?\" And I said, \"Yes, it is.\" And your PSW, yes. When you have learned now how to go to Popeyes, place your own order, pay for it, pick it up, that is a life skill. Yes. And I said, \"That is the program that you're in. And that's why you're in the HB Waiver Program because we can individualize it.\" So can you tell me a little bit about what else he does during the week when he's not at the gym? He'll do social media. He loves movies. He really likes the popcorn at movies. And so, we have movie days here and he gets to pick the movie. Okay. But he's come a long way with socializing online with a lot of the online gaming, figuring out the rules. And that's been a hard thing for him to realize what he thinks is fair and what truly is fair. Sure, sure, sure. So he's not in any post secondary ed programs. Is he working or volunteering anywhere currently? No. Pre-COVID? No? Okay. All right. And even his case manager with a waiver, just like, \"Nope.\" He is like, \"No, he's not ready.\" Whereas his brother works full-time. Same diagnosis, has Asperger's, takes the train. When he's ready, absolutely. Okay. Great. So the PSW works with him in the community. Mm-hmm . Works with him on daily living skills. I'm assuming, does he or she come to your home? I actually have two PSW's. Okay. I have one that comes to home and my husband's the other PSW. Okay. Okay. Do you want me to go get the goals from that program? It's totally okay, mm-mm . Because I've got it in the notebook. It's okay. All right. I just have to get this in here. We did the waiver program in New York State too. And about how many hours during an average week does he spend with the PSW, would you say? Because of COVID, I'm only using one PSW, which is my husband, and he is using over a hundred hours a week. And before COVID, how many hours a week with the home-based waiver PSW. They both are home-based waiver PSW's. Oh, he gets paid from the home base. Okay. Yup, yup, yup. Yeah, my husband does, and the other one. Okay. He would be about five hours a week, the other one and Ivan knew the routine too, was very set on routine. As soon as he showed up, he would go show him exactly what for lunch and give him the can of soup that he wanted to learn to make with him and things like that, that he knew. Or they would go play Pokémon GO, and things like that. Good way to get him out of the house. Absolutely. So has he ever been enrolled in any kind of academic program, like at a community college or a vocational school? No. Okay. And so, currently, he's not working for . Yes. That's about it for this one. Yeah. Great. Now we're going to talk about services. So, the service access assessment we're going to do, you've answered some of these for me already, just by talking to me, but I have to go through the whole list anyway. So, just go with me if you don't mind. So I'm going to go through a list of services that he may or may not be receiving. And let me know if you don't know what the service is, I'll do my best to fill you in. And then, if he is not receiving, I'll ask you if he currently needs it.\n",
            "finishThis will keep you going. Yeah, absolutely. This is about his employment experiences, and his experiences with post-secondary programs. First we're going to talk about any employment and volunteering he did while he was in high school. Did he ever work when he was in high school? In the transitions program? Oh, no. Is that considered high school? That's still considered high school, even though it's after he got his degree. You're talking about the one that he did after his degree, right? Yes. He did work. An hour and a half a day at a lot of jobs. Five or more would you say? Oh yeah. Five or more, definitely. Okay. Did he receive payment for those jobs? Yes. $5 a day. Okay. I'm going to ask you a few questions. Let's pick ... Can we either talk specifically about either one job he held the longest, or maybe the one he had at the very last job he had before he finished? Okay. Well, the one before he finished, let's do that. Okay. Where was it? What was it called? It was at Subway in Woodfield Mall. Great. Did he find the job through the transition program? Yes. Okay. Great. One sec. You said how many hours a week did he work? One and a half? That's a day. It was a day, so 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, like five and a half hours a week. Okay, great. Hold on one sec. I'm sorry. 7 hours. Do you remember what month he began working? What month of the year? Okay. I'm going to fudge on this little, I'll say August, then ended in May. What year was that? Geez, it was so many years ago. It was two years. 2018 put down, I think there was ... Yeah, 2018. Okay, great. Thanks. Did he receive any ... First, can you tell me a little bit about what he did at the Subway? Okay. He did the usual that they do with all these jobs, because this is all the things they can do. Wash the floor, clean the tables, clean the bathroom. That was it. The only difference with this job was that they tried to teach him how to make subway sandwiches. He had a problem because his small motor skills, you have to cut the bread a certain way. He had a problem with that. He couldn't cut it right after hundreds of times of trying, and he couldn't wrap it up the paper around the sandwich the way they wanted it. He couldn't do it. We even tried at home. Oh, okay. Yeah. Did he receive- His boss was great. Did he get any support while he was working on this job? A job coach? Yeah. Well, they had a job coach, just, no. I'm going to say no. They're going to say yes if you go to the school, but I say no, because they didn't walk in there and help him with anything. They just looked at him and walked out. They would walk in. Yeah, and say, what are you doing? Oh, that's great, and walk out the door. Okay. They didn't actually stay there with them, and walk them through what they were supposed to do, or help. Okay. I guess if we're on this job, no. A few in the beginning, yes, but towards the end? No. Okay. Do you think that this job was a good fit for Casey's skills and interests? No. Okay. Because of the small motor skills, right? Right. Can you tell me ... Anything else you want to add to that about why it wasn't a good fit? He's all thumbs, and he gets nervous when he can't do something because he's been called a dummy so many times in his life. Well, his father was one of them. Oh God, this is recorded. Okay. Well, his father will never see this, will he? No. Okay. Well, it started with that. Then it started in grammar school, and then it just went ... He's been called a dummy and a retard so many times, that as soon as he hears anything, he goes off the wall and gets upset and can't do it, or if someone even looks at him like they think he's stupid, and people in these jobs, some of them were doing that to these ... Not just him, but to the other kids too. That's why I don't understand where are these people that are supposed to be helping them? He had a boss, also, that called him dumb because he couldn't, at Baskin Robbins, because he couldn't scoop the ice cream the way he wanted it scooped, so he said he was dumb. Well, that ended that day when he came home and told me. Yeah. Yeah, of course. That was the end of that job. The school was very unhappy with me. I don't blame you. Nobody wants their child in a situation like that. Yeah. The kid is already in a bad situation and then you, the school, lets them talk to them like that? Right. Did he volunteer in the community at all during high school? Yeah. For the NWSRA, he tried to ... He was a golf coach at one of the local golf courses for kids with physical disabilities. Okay, great. We worked at an animal shelter. Great. Okay. What did he do at the animal shelter? We had, well, it was mostly him. He had to clean. Clean out the cages, clean the floor, feed the cats or ... Yeah, it was cats. Feed the cats. It worked out real good until one time two of the cats got out the door. Tricky cats. He got them though. Oh, good. Good, good, good. Okay. For the rest of this interview, I'm going to ask you about academic programs, employment, and volunteering that he's done after high school. First, I'd like to get an idea how Casey usually spends his time. Can you tell me about the activities that he participates in during a typical week, thinking about employment, volunteering, or any academic programs? Oh, okay. It's real simple. This is what he does. We play a game of scrabbles every night. He goes to the PGA store to hit golf balls, and once a week he'll go golfing. If he has the money, he'll do a round of golf. He almost every other day he goes to Dunkin Donuts for the half priced iced coffee. Okay. What about his work schedule? His work schedule? It's 10 to two. It's generally 10 to two. How many days a week? Five days a week. Okay. That's at UPS, right? Right. Okay. In Anderson. Does he do any academic programs, or not even ..? I know you mentioned you were thinking about Harbor College, but does he do any other programs, or anything? No. No. He tried it. The online, it just doesn't work for him. It's, unfortunately, nothing right now. Is he getting any job support at UPS, besides the boss that we like? Any official? No, no. He's got a terrific boss. Okay. He does not get formal. No, formally, no. But has a terrific boss. Okay. I'll ask you more about the boss in just a second. Okay. Does he ... Okay, great. Let's see. How many ..? That's 10 to two every Monday through Friday. 10 to 11 and 12. Four hours a day. About 20 many hours a week, he works? Yeah. It could anywhere from 17 to 20. Great. Okay. Okay. Let's see. UPS. Can you tell me a little bit about what Casey does at the program? I mean at his job, sorry. At his job? Unloads trailers. That's trucks, right? Yeah. Yeah. Does he- Takes boxes off trucks. Is this at the warehouse? Is this at people's homes? No, no. This is at the warehouse. Okay. Anything else he does there? They've tried ... Okay. I don't know how to explain it. It's called ... He has done small sort, sorting out little packages by weight. One time he was putting labels on them. Okay. Those are the only two that I can think of that he told me about. Okay, great. Does he receive any ..? Oh, you told me no support. I don't know why I was about to ask you that. He gets informal support. He gets, but their not formal. Does the boss ..? What types of things does the boss do? He emotionally supports him by being nice, and kind, and he jokes with him. Does he do anything in terms of support with showing him what to do? Can you talk about that a little bit? Yeah. Yeah. He does. He goes in there, shows him what to do, watches him a few times or whatever, and then he walks away, but then he'll come back and if things aren't going right, if Casey can't do it, I guess, from what Casey tells me, sometimes he'll pull him off and have him doing something else. One of the couple of the other two things I was telling you about. Yeah. Yeah. He just doesn't automatically say, \"Get out of here.\" He puts him onto something else. Then whoever the supervisor is for that will show him. Okay. Great. That's great. I'm glad. That's nice to hear. Yeah, it is. How did he find this job? I found it. Just looking for seasonal work, just online. It's how it started out, at last Christmas. He liked it. He picked it up again when he couldn't work at the golf course anymore. They were just ready for him to come back? No, but they pulled his file and saw that he had worked there before. I guess he must have done all right, because the supervisor remembered him. They took him back. That's great. Okay. You answered that. Do you remember around the month and year he started working at UPS? Okay. It would've ... The seasonal, or this time? Let's go with this time. Okay. This time it was May 5th. Okay. Don't ask me why I remember, but it was May 5th is when he started. Of this year, 2020. Of 2020. Yeah. Has he participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since leaving high school? Yeah, he worked at Shamburg golf course for the summer. Okay. What did he do there? A cart attendant. The person that brings the cart out, that people drive around in. Okay. He was a caddy at Mitia country club. At the same time? At the same time. Yeah, he would ... When he wasn't at the one, on the weekends, he would go to the other one. Okay. Let me ask you about the golf course first, then I'll ask you about the Mitia, if you don't mind. Okay. Was he paid for the Shamburg golf course job? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Did he get any supports at that job? Not really. Okay. Does he currently work there? No. Okay. How did he find that job? Well, we walked in. I asked about it, and then when they said, \"Yeah, we'd like to talk to him,\" we drove over there. I stayed in the car and he walked in. Okay. He just filled out an application and they took him. Great. Yeah. Okay. How many hours a week did he work there? If you can remember off the top of your head? Oh, generally, maybe like 15 hours? No, no, no. About 12. About 12 hours a week. Can you remember the month that he started, or month and year he started that job, roughly? Yeah, 2019. April 2019 until November of 2019. Thank you. A good memory. Yeah, because that's the season. That's how I know. Oh, right, right, right. That was the next question was why did he leave? Is it because the season was over? Yeah, the season was over. Okay. Okay. Great. You said the other one is called, what is it? Mitia. Mitia country club. Is that spelled like like the Mitia temple? Is it M I T I A. Yes. Exactly. Okay. Can you tell me, what was he doing there please? What kind of activities? He was a caddy, is the person that walks around the golfer. Oh, right. They carry your bags and they have to find the ball. Okay. Great. Did he receive supports at this job? No. No. This one, no. They had one day of training, and that was all. Okay. Was he paid for this one? It was tips if they wanted to. Yeah. They gave tips, the kids a tip. Okay. Can you ... Oh, first, can you tell me, how did he find this job? Again, me calling over there. They said, \"Well, why don't you bring the kid in?\" So I did. I had to stay in the parking lot because it's exclusive and I had shorts on. That's why I remember it. I couldn't go out of the car. He actually walked in himself. That's how bad he wanted it. That's great. He surprises me sometimes. Yeah. He was shaking like a leaf. That was his first time he had to sell himself. I guess he did because the boss walked out with him, came up to me and said, \"All right. We'll take him.\" Wow. Well, good. That's great. Yeah. How many hours on average would you say did he work there per week? Oh God. Well, actual working hours, or just sitting around waiting to do a round? I think it's any hours he was expected to be on location. Okay. Well, he'd be there ... All right, when he did it in the summer, and the days when he did, it was ... He could sit there for ... It could be any ... This is hard because it could be anytime. They started at six in the morning and he ... All right. Let's make it general. Say six in the morning, till three in the afternoon. They'd have to sit and wait and wait. If you did get a round, you usually were done by three or four. I'll say six to three. About nine hours. How many days? Was that the weekends? That was on the weekends. It could be up to 18 hours? Yep. Okay. Sometimes he sat there and got nothing. That's frustrating I bet. Yeah. Oh yeah, but it teaches you patience. Definitely. I'd never do it. I wouldn't either, and it's hot. Yeah. Do you remember the month and year he started this activity? Was it the same? He started three years ago. Okay. 2017. Okay. Do you remember, was it June? Again, it would be April. April. Okay. And goes till November. Goes till November. That's season, right? Okay. That would be November of 2017? Well, he's been doing it ... This year, geez, he went twice and didn't get anything. 2017, 2018, and 2019. Okay. I'm putting that in there. Yeah. Okay. 2017, 2018. Okay. Any other jobs, or vocational or volunteering since leaving high school? Did we miss anything? No. No. I think we've got everything. Look at that, and it's 11:58. Thanks for pushing forward. Perfect. Done. All right. Yay. Okay. I already sent you the links to all the different surveys, in case you wanted to try them tonight, that's up to you. You don't have to. No, because I put today aside for whatever, so that's ... I'll do it. Okay. Great. Janice got your goals. Really, tomorrow is just going to be, you and I will do the , and then Casey will pick his goals. I'll ask him a couple questions about the jobs that we just talked about, just to get his impressions. That's part of our survey, but yeah, that's it. You got to vote. Yeah. We're doing 2:30 tomorrow, right? Just to make it easier. 2:30. Great. I'll call you then. Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "finishOkay, thanks. So first I'm just going to ask you a few questions about your job at UPS. And then after that, I'll tell you what we'll do after that. But first we'll just do this. Okay. So your job at UPS. Do you feel like it's a good fit for you? I think so. Okay. Can you tell me why? Well, I enjoy doing it. I mean, it's a good company to work for. And it's better than the other stuff I've been doing in the past. How is it better than other things you've done in the past? Because it's more rewarding and the other jobs,  through the other services. It was basically just like cleaning garbage and stuff like that, and I just ... that's basically it. Okay, great. Okay. That was all I needed to ask you about, UPS. So that was easy, right? Oh-\n",
            "finishOkay, thank you. Now we go on the next page. Ethan is not in high school? No. Yeah, I think he ... Do you mind telling me when did he exit the high school system? This is 2221, so 2015? 2016? About six years ago. Like 2015. Right? Right. Yeah. Do you mind telling me what does a typical week look like for Ethan? How has he been spending his time? Playing games, watching television, on this laptop, going out and get lunch, taking walks. That's about it. Now is he involved in any vocational training program or unpaid internship? No. Is he involved in any post-secondary education program? No. Do you mind telling me, what is the main activity in which Ethan is currently involved now? His laptop. Thank you. Do you mind telling me how many total hours during the average week does Ethan spend, particularly in all of the vocational and educational activities? Oh, zero. One second. Now, we will talk about the school program that Ethan attended after high school. Is he currently enrolled, or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, career college, or university? He was enrolled in community college for two or three weeks, but had to drop out because they did not have readers to assist him with his classes.  Do they have any plans to let him and enroll back to the community college? Well, I looked into that, and with COVID, pretty much they're doing a lot of online classes. For his disability, it would be online classes he would have to enroll in. Right now, he is not in any academic program at this point? No. No. Is Ethan currently participating in any employment, vocational, or volunteering activity? No. Okay, so we'll go on the last page. During the first visit, we set three annual goals with you and Ethan. The purpose of this goal development was to support the family in helping the young youth pursue their dream for the future and really start working on these goals. Since about a year has passed, we would like to know how they're doing with these goals. Before we continue and discuss his progress, we feel it is important to say that we understand that a lot can happen in a year.\n",
            "finish. You know, I'm not sure. I'm right-handed also, so I- So am I. So I don't have any tips or tricks either. I know. I never thought of it. Okay. So, the last time we spoke, we discussed some activities that Casey had been involved in. We would love to hear what he's doing now. So as, of the last interview, Casey was not in high school or receiving any services through the school system. Is that correct? That's correct. Okay. So did Casey exit the school system since the last time we spoke, or was it before then? It was before. Okay. So for this section, I'm going to ask you about the academic programs, employment and volunteering activities that Casey has attended or been a part of since the last time we spoke. First, I'd like to get an idea of how Casey usually spends this time. So let's talk about the activities he participates in during a typical week. What does a typical week look like for Casey, and how has he been spending his time? Well, it's pretty regimented, because it's the way he likes it. Gets up in the morning to tell me everything planned out, what we're going to do that day. Then he goes to work, then he's home by about three o'clock. Then we get the list again of everything we're going to do, with a few more things added on. Then we'll go swimming. It's either every day or every other day we go swimming. Or we go to the grocery store, because lately we've been getting food for just a couple of days at a time. He's borderline diabetic, so we're going, learning. Looking at, what can you eat? What can't you eat? Reading labels. And he doesn't like to do anything for too long. So I figured, \"Okay, we're not going to do a big shopping.\" So we do that, go grocery shopping. Because there's always something. Then either we go walking, that's to relieve stress. We walk. We take some pretty long... And then we eat supper, which he usually will help me with. And then, we play the video games for a while, and then he reads. And either sees his friend... He sees his friend maybe once a week. The one, he doesn't see too often, but sees a friend once a week. And then he goes in bed. And that's it. I'm sorry. Another thing is... Well, now it doesn't apply. Golfing is about over. He will go golfing. You could stick golfing in there somewhere if you want. Although it's about done. Oh, I'm sorry. He's a caddy. He caddies on the weekend. Okay. But that's done. Okay. So you said that... It says, \"Please select the activities which Casey is currently involved.\" So not a post-secondary program, not vocational training? No. I wish. But he is working for pay? Yes. And would you say that was with support, or would you say that's independently? Independent, without support. Okay. And then how many total hours during the average week does Casey spend participating in all of these vocational and educational activities? So the working for pay independently. How many hours a week? Oh. Between the working and what else? I think just the working. Just the working? Well, he works about 15 to 18 hours a week. It can go up to 20. It all depends. A shift can be three to five hours. So, I'd say average, 15 to 18 hours a week. Okay. So now we're going to talk about school programs that Casey attended after high school. So please discuss all post-secondary educational activities back to the check-in that was completed on May 4th. Is Casey currently enrolled, or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college, college or university? He was enrolled in one last winter, and he dropped out after the first day. So what is the name? Sorry. Can you tell me about those school programs, beginning with the most current to the most... Or the most recent one, and then we're going to work backwards? That was the only one. That was the only one. That's an easy one. So what is the name of the schooler program? Harper. It was Harper College in Palatine. And it was supposed to be a Microsoft Word, but he never got past the first class. Like I said, we're waiting for the school to open up. And he's supposed to look it up for me and tell me what the classes are, and then we work from there. Because since he doesn't work a 40 hour week, he can go. Okay. And that's where the excess money goes, to pay for that. Stuff like that. Okay. So is this an autism or a disability specific program? No, this was not, but there were supports. That's why it was so great. Like tutors, people in the language or computer lab. Because he won't do anything. We tried. I tried, and he wouldn't do it. If he had to have supports that he considers for 'those disabled people,' he calls them, he won't do it. That's why if this comes up again, as soon as it's, 'you can go into the classroom again,' he will be doing it. Okay. What type of program did Casey attend? So, was he non-degree seeking? Was he working towards an associate's degree? He was just starting off at just individual classes. He can only take one at a time, at a time. Because then it's too mind-boggling, I think. So it would've gone towards... You can get a certificate or you can get an associate's degree, but he'll never do four year. There's no way. I don't think he could ever do it. So you had mentioned a certificate. Was he planning on eventually working towards a certificate, or was it just taking some classes ? Yeah, just taking some classes. I've researched those programs, at least around here. And Harper was the only place around here. And I even got into it with one somebody when they had open houses, and the supports and everything were ridiculous. And the classes were ridiculous, as far as how they handled them. It was a waste of money. The kid wouldn't be doing anything. So the supports were not supports. A tutor who was never there, a tutor that showed up once a week. No. So I don't like... And why do you have someone going for a college education who doesn't... They don't qualify. If you don't qualify, you don't. Then you should be taught something vocational, a trade. Something like that, anything. Like what Casey does. He's not college material. Why would you waste these humongous tuitions on that? Okay. Because it'll never do him any good, anyhow. Okay. Can you remind me, do you remember the month and year that he started this program? I think it was February of 2020. Okay. God, it seems like a million years. Everything from last year, seems like. Yeah. You said he had dropped before it really got started. So would you say that he left the program in the same month? Yeah. Oh, same day. Okay. He didn't waste any time. So what was Casey's reason for leaving this program? He chose to leave, correct? He couldn't understand. He really wanted to do it. He couldn't. The teacher was going too fast. I was sitting next to him going, \"Oh?\" And I couldn't even follow. Was Casey receiving supports from within the class or within the program? No. No. If he had been in person like we planned, he would've had supports. But since it was virtual, there were no supports. Okay. Do you feel as though this program was a good fit? Not what it turned into, no. What it was supposed to be, yeah. But virtually, no. Okay. Is Casey currently enrolled in another school or program? No. Sorry. Can you tell me about the jobs or programs, beginning with the most recent job or program, working back to the last time? So you said he is currently employed? Yeah. At UPS, yeah. Okay. Can you describe this activity? So, what does Casey do while he's at work? Well, it's easy. Packing or unloading trucks is the main thing. There's a lot of little things, but they're nothing. Packing and unloading trucks, that's the big. Okay. Does Casey receive supports while participating? No. Okay. This was a paid activity. And you had previously mentioned how he had found this job. We were fooling around looking at... Oh, we saw on television. UPS looking for seasonal help. It was last Christmas. No, this Christmas? Wouldn't it be the Christmas before? Oh God. 2019. Seasonal help, he did that. And we saw it was just ads on television. Okay. So do you remember the month and year Casey started this activity? It would've been October of 2019. Okay. But is this- Sorry. You can go. No. Go. Okay. Is this job a good fit for Casey skills and interests? Yes, because it keeps him busy. And it gets him talk to more people. He's socializing a little more. Not outside of work, but at least at work. He's meeting different kinds of people, it's a good socialization thing. Because he has to work with somebody, so. Okay. Is he currently participating in any other employment, vocational or volunteer activities? No. Well, we were volunteering at couple of animal shelters until he let a cat run out the door. It ran in the street and well, that was the end of that. So . But then they fired him. So did that happen since May? Between May and now? Yeah. Between May and now. Oh actually no, no. It was last year. See how I'm mixing up the years? It was last year. Oh God. I totally get it. And he refuses to go to these places, no? No. I don't blame them. She was mean.\n",
            "finishI am recording. All right. So is Petro still in high school? No. Okay. Did he work at all during high school? He did a job training. Okay. Yes. Did he get paid for any of those jobs? No. No. Okay. Did he volunteer during high school? It was job training, so I wouldn't call it volunteering. Okay. But nothing out in the community separate from the job training? No. Okay, great. Can you, so for the rest of this one, I'm going to talk to you about sort of ideas of before COVID, how he spends his time. What does a typical week look like for Petro before COVID? Before COVID, he had only two weeks of a day program because he graduated from his educational portion and so his day program took over the transition program. So in the morning he would have BCBA therapist working on showering and dressing and eating. Then he would go to... He'd take the Pace bus, go to his day program, come back with the Pace bus, and then he had activities, whether it's piano lessons or swim lessons or ice skating. So, he would do that maybe two times a week. Okay. Does that help? Yes. Yep. Absolutely. Okay, great. About how many hours during the average week did he participate in the day program? Just for those two weeks. From nine to three. So six hours a day. Okay. Correct. Great. Does he participate in any employment or vocational activities? No. Okay, Great. That it was that one. Okay. All right. Now we're going to call Janice and then she will...\n",
            "finish... just volunteer. I mean, like Feed My Starving Children and the food pantry at church, and he says sometimes he helps clean up after church, but never a paid position. Okay, great. Okay. Hold on one sec. That was it for that one. So what we're going to do next is we're going to talk about ... we are going to talk about different services that Cody may or may not be receiving. Okay. And if you're not sure what this-\n",
            "finishHistory. So did he... Has Marshall worked during high school? Not \"worked\" worked. Hold on one second. No, no problem. You have your phone, right? Yeah, in my drawer. Okay. Not for money. Okay. He has done a ton of volunteer hours. Like he volunteers for Brookfield zoo. He's a king conservation science scholar was what they call it. And since the summer of eighth grade, he has volunteered like 270 hours.  What's  king conservation? Sorry to interrupt you. King, like K-I-N-G. King. Conservation science scholar. At Brookfield zoo. So it's somewhere like 250 or 270 hours that he has volunteered there over the last two years. Wow. Okay. And it's a fairly independent activity for him. Everyone is buddied up with somebody for the day, because it's a group of teenagers. So like it's not just off on his own, but like I do just drop him off and then pick him up. So it's an area of independence that is... It's just been a good thing for him. Yeah. What kinds of things does he do at the job at Brookfield zoo? Lots of things. So like they'll station the scholars at different exhibits. So you're at the penguins or whatever. And they've already gone through learning quite a bit about that area, that animal, that animal's conservation, what people around the world are doing for conservation for that animal. That animal's natural habitat. What they eat. And he's information... Like retain information. He is like a database when it comes to something he's interested in. And so he's gone through classes. So like, they'll go and they'll learn a whole bunch about penguins. Like sometimes his volunteering will be to go to a informational class. There's a lot of volunteering that is... They call it interpretation. Where you have a schedule and like you're stationed by the giraffes for an hour and a half, then you're stationed over here for an hour and a half. Then you break for lunch and then you go here. So there's different types of buckets of volunteer hours all within this program. Some of them are college and career readiness bucket hours. Which are going to different classes. I mean, he had to do whole onboarding process as you would with a job. He had to go through a diversity and harassment training. Customer service training. So it's been a really good program for him. So it's a way for him to... He interacts. He's with a lot of different type of people and a lot of the interactions are great and appropriate because they're information, factual. But then when that piece is over, then he could ask totally inappropriate... So yeah...  Go a little too far. There's no shyness there. And we're already talking. So are you married? You know what I mean? How many kids do you have? Like how many... Do people really want somebody to be asking them that when they're just visiting the zoo? I don't... But... It's all learning, right? Yeah. But it's amazing opportunity and it's some place he has spent a lot of time. And it's been really, really good for him and his life. Okay. And has he volunteered anywhere else during high school? There's been a lot of other little places, like cleaning up the streets event like in our area that our ward might have. Like we're in ward nine. So clean up the streets or go clean up Blackberry farm, which is something that the Fox valley park district owns. Or feed my starving children. Or like just different one off things. So he's got... The zoo is like... I forget if it's 250 or 270 volunteer hours. And then in addition, he has got like 50 more of just like one off things like that. So he has volunteered a really large amount of hours. It sounds almost like the volunteering at the Brookfield zoo is... It is his job. It's...  Yeah. He's technically an employee. He's technically an employee of the Chicago zoological society. He's not paid employee, but like you have a badge, and you have a uniform, and you have to clock in, and you have to clock out. And you have to abide by the rules. You do get some perks. You get discounts like for food or for this or that. So he's technically an employee of theirs. But after spending this amount of time and showing the dedication he has to the program, he could become a part-time employee there. Now it's not right around the corner. Yeah. How does he get to and from? One of us. Okay. But like his brother drives now. His brother didn't drive last summer. So it was one of us last summer. This summer there hasn't been volunteering yet. Like normally they would've been doing normal, like regular volunteering hours. And there hasn't been this summer due to COVID. So like we don't know. Were we ready for his twin brother to be on the highway? Would we have him just take Ogden all the way there? Like we didn't have to cross that bridge because of COVID yet. So they usually volunteer... Not always, but usually on the same day. They're not buddied up and spend the day together. They kind... So everyone... But like they're usually volunteering. Not always, but usually on the same day. So didn't have to cross that bridge yet. Now we could and had thought about like maybe a next step being them together. Because Marshall wouldn't be ready on his own, but like to take the train there. Like maybe drive the car to the route 59 train station and take it to the zoo stop. And then you have like a two block walk to the zoo. Right. And when he's doing that volunteering, does he have any job support? Like a job coach or anyone helping? Oh.\n",
            "finishOkay. So we go next section. So we finish this part, we go by next section. Last time we spoke, we discussed some activity Jasmine has been involved in. We would love to hear what she's doing now. So Jasmine, is she still in high school? Is that correct? Yeah. Yes. Is she expecting to exit high school in 2024? Am I correct? Yes, Mm-hmm . August 2024. Mm-hmm . Well, they gave them an extra year. They gave them until '22. Oh, so not it's August 2022. No. They gave, wait a minute. So it used to be when you turned on your 22nd birthday? Yeah. Now they gave them an extra year. Okay. So I never thought, so she's 19. So she'll actually get another four years, so it'll be 2025. Oh, so she would exit in August 2025? Mm-hmm . Okay. So is Jasmine currently working? No. Do you mind telling me why Jasmine is not currently working? Because she's still in school and yeah. Now we are going to look for the past high school job. Has Jasmine worked and left any job since May 5th 2021? No. Has Jasmine volunteer in the community during high school since last time we spoke? No. Still in high school. So do you have any comments on this part about her high school? . Now we'll move to the next part. Okay. This is the last Section. During the first visit, we set three annual goals with you and Jasmine. The purpose of this goal development was to support family in helping the young youth pursue her dreams for the future and really start working on these goals. Since about year has passed we would like to know how they are doing with this goals. Before we continue and discuss her progress we feel it is important to say that we understand that a lot can happen in a year and that past year was especially unpredictable. We also understand that COVID might have imposed barrier to complete certain goals. The first goal was focusing on different type of personal information. Within a year, without prompt, Jasmine would be able to provide three different types of personal information when asked by a safe, unknown person. That information for example, home address, mom and dad's phone number. So over the.\n",
            "finishGreat. So this is a vocational assessment just to kind of get an idea of whether or not he's ever worked or volunteered while he was in high school. So has he ever had a job or worked during high school? Never had a job or worked during high school. Never. Okay. How about volunteering? Did he volunteer? Not in school. I introduced him to volunteerism maybe about two and a half years ago. It was a little nursing home, not too far from our house. He would go in, we'd go in once a week or once ...  no, it was like twice a month, but we would go in and help with the bingo games. He'd pass out the bingo cards to the seniors and just those ... and then once ... That's one day and then another day they had these church services on various days and he would go and we'd pass out programs and participate. Okay. And then it stopped. My mom passed away and then we stopped. We did that though consistently for about six months. Then they welcomed us back and then, of course COVID came about. So he has volunteered before. Okay. Can you give me the name of the senior citizen home? Okay. Advance? They changed the name. But if you could pull ... I wish I had Google in front of me. Advantar, A-D-A-N-T-A-R. I don't know if it's a rehab facility. Because they changed the name, but it's in Evergreen Park, Illinois, on 90 ... approximately 90, about 100 and Kettridge. So if you Google it, it'll come up. Yeah. I'll get it. Mm-hmm . Yeah. On 100th and Kettridge. That was about maybe two years, three, about two years ago. Something like that. He hasn't done ... That's the only volunteering he's ever done, and he did it for about six months. Okay, great. Great. That was quick. So now this next one-\n",
            "finishSo for this part, last time we spoke we discussed some activities that Marshall had been involved in. We'd love to hear what he is doing now. So, we'll start by talking about his high school experiences. Can you please describe Marshall's current high school situation? Is he still in high school, or receiving services through the school system? I know you mentioned part of this already, throughout our interview, but- We deferred him. Yeah. We deferred his diploma. He will still be within that school district next year after, like... having already received all of his credits to graduate.  Mm-hmm . And he'll be with the school district-  We don't know what it's going to look like, you know?  Uh huh.  We should, but we don't know what it's going to look like.  So, he'll be with the school district in a transitional program, correct?  Yes. Which is 100% special education, not that they .  So... okay.  He's going from 3% special education to 100% special education, all day every day. It is a problem that I'm going to have to fight it.  Marshall's high school track or plans changed since the last time we spoke? I know... I just want to clarify about the whole deferred diploma thing, I guess, for this.  We didn't know if we were going to defer diploma.  Mm-hmm , so  would you say that's a change from what you guys had originally-  Yeah. I mean, we were going to have to make a decision, though, anyways. Graduation was coming, and either you take the diploma or you don't take the diploma. Do you know what I mean? So, with the beginning we didn't know, my husband and I didn't know, but COVID kind of defined that and made that clearer for us, I guess.  And when is Marshall planning on exiting high school? So, completely not receiving any services through the school system, including transition program?  If it were Marshall's plan, that would've been on May 22nd.  Uh, no, so I'm asking when would he be exiting completely from high school, so including no more services through a transition program either. We'll have to evaluate that in a year. I mean, yeah, he can stay through age 21, which is probably not at all what he's going to do.  Mm-hmm . So, you mentioned, so he'll just be doing next year?  We're taking it year by year.  Okay.  We could close his diploma whenever we want to, I could walk in there today and take it. You know what I mean? So, all you have to do is say, \"I am dropping special education, and give us his diploma.\" Or the regular diploma, he'd take it whenever he wants. So, it's really up to us when we decide to do that. If we're not happy with services next year, if they're not willing to budge and individualize him then they could take it next year.  Just for the sake of the protocol of what is asking, what would you say your current thinking is, I guess, for...  Probably a year.  Okay. So, next year, I'm .  Yeah.  And that will be around the end of the school year? Like, June?  Yeah.  Do you think?  Mm-hmm .  Okay.  Yup.  Okay. Got it. And, okay, so next up is we're going to be talking about high school employment. Is Marshall currently working?  No.  Okay. And he's not... I'm just kind of going off of what you mentioned already, this is mainly due to the whole COVID situation, is that correct? You know, the whole thing we talked about, his volunteering experience-  Probably with his vocational training, yeah. I mean, he would need vocational training in order to have a job. That would have to start with supported employment.  Mm-hmm .  And that's not currently set up. Hopefully he'll get more of that through the transition program. And his volunteer work that we vary some more. That's not been... they're not even doing that program yet, I guess.  Has Marshall worked and left any job since the baseline visit of last year?  No.  Okay. And has Marshall volunteered in the community during high school since the last time we spoke during the baseline? So, between then and now, has he volunteered, or was the volunteering stopped before the last time we spoke-  It stopped. Yeah.  He stopped that before the last time we spoke with you, or was that-  Yeah, I would say no, he has not volunteered since .  Mm-hmm , okay. And is there anything else you would like to tell us about... or any other updates you want to share about Marshall that we have not discussed yet?  No, I think I've been telling you everything.  Okay. So, that's the end of the vocational activity. And that's, I want to thank you so much for taking your time to talk with us today. This would not be possible without your participation. And so before I let you go, I just want to verify your current email address, and your mailing address that we have. So, for your email we have... \n",
            "finishGraduated years ago. Yeah. Did Ivan exit school system, since April 30, 2021? No. No. Ivan graduated back in 2016. Now, he's not receiving any service through the school system? He stopped receiving any school services in 2016. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. He graduated when he was 17. Do you mind telling me what does a typical week look like for Ivan? How has he been spending his time? He does a lot of online time. He tries to work out with me. He goes to the grocery store, and does his shopping. He likes to attend movies now, that has changed since we last spoke, because movie theaters weren't open then. Okay. Just like you mentioned before, is that through the waiver program? Now he is in the adult daycare, adult day program? No. He's not- Am I right? He's in no adult... He has never been in adult program. Thank you. Is he volunteering the community, in the community? He goes out in the community with his personal service worker and me, but he's not going to do any adult program. Okay. All they are is glorified babysitting. They're a waste of money. Okay. All right. Do you mind telling me, how many total hours during the average week, does Ivan spend participating in all of this vocational and educational activity? Okay, he does not do any... His life skills are part of his home-based waiver services. His vocational is part of his life's, his vocational home-based waiver services. He's in no traditional, formal program. He is in individualized home-based program. Okay. We make every opportunity a teaching and learning opportunity for him. There is no set number of hours per day, per week. You have to be flexible with these kids, adults. Okay. Okay. Are you still there? Yeah, I'm still typing, because this is a really good program. Actually, this is the program I first heard about it. Since, do not have a set time. Okay. How long would this home-based program last? This home-based program is the Medicaid Waiver Program. Yeah. It lasts as long as we want to use it. Okay. Thank you. It can last for another 20 years for him. Okay. It teaches him his life skills. Okay. All right. When you talk to him about being in the program, he's going to give you the goofiest look and say, \"I'm not in any formal program.\" Okay. Because it's built into his daily schedule. Yes. He went and made his own breakfast. Okay. All right. Now, I'm... The next question I think is no... I just double check with you. Is Ivan currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college or university? No. No. Is Ivan currently participate in any employment, vocational, or volunteering activity? Sure, through the home-based waiver program. As I stated, his personal service worker worked for the hotel industry. He works with him on various skills. Okay. Same skills that he worked on in school. Okay. It's the same employment skills. But has much better supervision, because at school they would not supervise. Yeah. Their idea of supervision was letting him clean glass and go out for a smoke. Okay. Right. That's not supervision, but that's what the schools did. That's why he's in the home-based waiver program, so it can be individualized. Okay. What is the name of company? Is he currently working in some place, like a company or business? No. No. He is not employable. He is not working, but he's still working for the personal worker on the employment training? Correct. The skill? Okay. There you go. Yes, there are goals set and everything like that. Okay. Does he understand that what he is doing? No. Okay. If you ask him, he won't understand what you're saying.

Well, Thanksgiving, her father, they sometimes do the food serving. She would just really help him carry items. Unfortunately, food is kind of a distraction for her. Okay. So we can't keep her around it, but I guess just minimal, helping to carry items. That's pretty much it. Okay.\n",

No. No. Do you mind telling me when he exit high school? Oh, in June of 2020. June 2020. Okay. Okay. Do you mind telling me what does a typical week look like for Cody? How has he spending his time? Cody, you want to answer that? He basically stays in his room, and does his homework, and comes down to eat. That's about it. He had a job over the summer, that's about it. All right. Okay. So is Cody is currently involved in the post-secondary involved program? Yes, he goes to community college. Okay. So how many total hours during the average week does Cody spend participating in all of this vocational and education activity? He has 12 credit hours, so many hours of class do you have a week, Cody? Are you including studying time or just in class time? Just in class time. Oh.  Well, one of my classes doesn't meet in person, and the others are... one is two days a week for around an hour each day, and the other two are one day a week for two or three hours. So what'd that be? One...  You're the math person. I don't do math often enough... It's like six hours in class or something. Okay, six hours. But he has 12 credit hours. Okay. So he spends a lot of time- Yeah, I have one course that's all online. Yeah, it's just  anytime. Yeah. And it's just something like four hours of work each week. Okay. All right. Thank you. So now we are going to talk about school program that Cody attend after high school. Is Cody currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college? Community. Yes, I think you just said yes. Yeah. He is in community college now, right? Yes. Yes, thank you. Do you mind telling me what is the name if the school? College of Lake County. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about this program? It's to earn an associate's degree in computer science.  Associate's. And then go to a four year college, hopefully. Just anywhere. Okay. So this is an autism or disability-specific program? Nope, just regular community college. So this community college, he is pursuing a degree, right? Yes. Okay. Thank you. So what is Cody's area of study? Computer science. Computer science. Do you mind telling me again what is the average number of classes Cody is taking per semester? 12, he took 12 every semester. 12 hours. 12 hours, yeah. Like four classes. Yeah, four classes and three, but it's still 12 credit hours. 12 credit hours. Is Cody a full-time or part-time student? 12 hours is full-time. Full-time, okay. Do you remember the month and year Cody start this program? Yes, August of 2020. August 2020. August. Okay. Is Cody receiving support from this program? Only accommodations. Only accommodations. Do you feel this program is a good fit for Cody? Yeah, yes. Okay. Do you mind telling me why? He seems to be doing pretty well. COVID helps, because he can do it online and we don't have to drive him. Okay. He's doing it from home. Okay. If you have additional comment about this academic program or if there are any circumstance you would like to explain, do you mind telling me? Yes. They had a Transition Autism Program at Harper College, so we were looking into it, but because we didn't live in the district, he didn't quality for it. I think he would've benefited from something like that, but CLC doesn't have it. That might've helped him communicate with his teacher better last year, and then he might not have gotten the lower grade in English, but he did okay. Okay. But he needs to learn to community with his teachers a little bit better . Okay. So is Cody currently enrolled in another school or program? Nope, just the one. Okay. Now, we are looking at employment. Is Cody currently participate in any employment, vocational, or volunteering activity? No. He did over the summer. Okay. Okay. Okay, so we go to the last part. During the first visit, we set three annual goals with you and Cody. The purpose of this-\n",
            "finishDoes he receive any educational assistance or tutoring? No. Okay. And is that currently needed? Not currently, no. Okay. Does he receive any adult daycare service? No. Is that currently needed? No. Okay. Does he have a case manager or someone who coordinates the services he receives? He has a case coordinator through Doors and then he has a guidance counselor at the community college who would both fulfill those roles. And do you have to pay for any of the service with Doors or the guidance counselor from the community college? Well, no, I don't have to pay for any of it. Because we're not paying the tuition, Doors is. Got it. And how satisfied are you with those people, the case manager from the community college? The guidance counselor, I'm very satisfied. The Doors counselor, no, not very satisfied. So since those are combined now, it's just in the middle, somewhat? That's okay. Yep, that sounds good. Got it. Does he receive any other services because of special needs that we did not discuss earlier yet? Let me think about this. Other services, no. Okay. And is there any that you would say is currently needed? I think, with regard to transportation, there definitely is in need. I'm working with our community to try to make sure that if he does start driving independently, that he would be able to handle if he had any interaction with the police. So that would be the major thing, I think. Got it, okay. Is your son on a waiting list for any service? No. All right. So next up, now I'd like you to think back to the services that your son was receiving in February of 2020, so before the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm going to ask you some questions about house services now compared to services at that time. So first off, to what extent have your son's services resumed compared to services he was receiving back in pre-COVID? They've resumed more intermittently. So I guess, specifically, has the number of services changed since then or... No, everything's resumed. It's just the scope and the frequency. Okay. I guess some services were suspended at some point, right? Right. Were there alternative offers for telehealth rather than in person or something to accommodate for those changes that have happened due to COVID? There were telehealth visits, yes. And do you have any specific experience in needing to find new providers or agencies to help with services during COVID? No. Okay. And have there been any changes in the services that he received that you expect to be long term, so that they'll never go back to the way they were before COVID? No. Okay. And in regards to making decisions about whether or not to resume services impacted by COVID, what considerations do you have for making those decisions, I guess, back when some of them weren't resumed yet? I'm not sure I'm following. So I guess in terms of- What were the considerations? The deliberations that we went through to consider restarting services, is that where you're headed? Yeah. So thinking about things like safety concerns, things like- Oh, sure. Yeah. He has not returned to work because he would have to ride the train for 45 minutes, so that cuts him off from in-person services at work. So safety was definitely one of them. That's all I can really think of. And is William himself involved in making any of these decisions? Yes. And are any of those service providers or the agencies involved in these decisions you have about resuming services as well? No, not really. All right. That's done this section. So now we're going to move on to the vocational activity index. So last time we spoke, we discussed some activities that William had been involved in and we would like to hear about what he's doing now. So just to confirm, is William in high school any longer? No, he's in college. Got it. And did he exit the school system since the time that we last spoke with you or was it before then? You mean, did he leave public school system? Yes. It was prior to being involved in the study. All right. So for this section, I'm going to ask you about academic programs employment and volunteering activities that William has attended since the last time we spoke. So first, I'd like to get an idea of how William usually spends his time. So what does a typical week look like for William and how has he been spending his time? A typical week is, he works part-time, so that's three days a week usually from 9:30 to 2:30, and that's all been from home. It's all . There is some interaction with the guidance counselor role at his work, the people, but mostly he's just working independently. He takes a class one evening a week, and then he has three other classes that he usually spends Tuesday, and Thursday doing projects.\n",
            "finishYeah, we total have three. Okay. Let's go. Almost there. Let me see. You just mentioned, is  in transition program? Yes. So, he's extended high school, is that correct? Yes. He is in the postsecondary. He's post-high-school right now. OK. Is he currently working? He is not working. No. Okay. Do you mind, tell me why he is not currently working? Because he would need support working, and the school does not have the personnel available to be able to send him out in the community on a job right now. They have a limited number of staff that can do that, and they are prioritizing those students who are turning 21 this year. Has he worked and left any job since May 25th? He has never worked a job in his life, outside of in this home. Yeah. Has he volunteered in the community during high school, since last time we spoke? No. Okay. Actually, we finished this session. We go to the last session. Okay. So, during the first visit, we set three annual goals with you and Kieran. The first, the purpose of this goal development was to support family in helping him to pursue his dreams for the future, and really start working on these goals. Since-\n",
            "finishOkay. And then the stress got too much so he came back and he's worked for a while and he approached us and said he was ready to go back to school. He's actually taking four credit courses at College of DuPag. They are what's available to everybody there. It's not a specific autism program. Okay. Great. All right. Thank you. That's helpful. That helps center me. All right. While he was in high school, did he work? He worked a couple of summers infrequently for my husband in his office. Okay. And so total, how many jobs would that be? One or was it a couple different types of jobs? I would say one. Okay. And has he ever had a job or internship that was part of a high school program? No. And did he receive payment at any job that he did during high school? Yes. Okay. And what was the name of the company? You said it was your husband's company, if you don't mind. Yeah, it was RotaDyne, but we paid him, actually. Okay. How do I spell... That's okay, that still counts, but how do we spell the name of the company? RotaDyne, it's R-O-T-A-D-Y-N-E. Great. And about how many hours during those summer jobs on average, did he work at the job? I would say four. Okay, great. And let's see, can you remember around what month and year he began working at the job? Even if... I would say it was 2014 and it would've been June. Okay. Great. And do you remember when he stopped working at the job? Yeah, just summer but finally finished, I would say it was 2016. And that would've been July probably. Okay, great. And can you tell me a little bit about the job? What kind of job duties he had during that summer employment? He did two types. One was in the office where he would do filing. He would check over some forms, just clerical work, essentially. That was directly supervised by my husband sometimes, and then sometimes other people in the office. Okay. And then we had to work out on the plant floor because my husband's in manufacturing. He worked out there with hard hat and 110 degrees and things like that. And it was mostly just doing go for work, they'd say, \"Move this pile of stuff over here.\" Just general laborer work, I suppose. Okay. That's how to describe it. Great. Did he receive any kind of formal support while he was working or even informal support, like job coaching? Oh, absolutely, yeah. Okay. Can you describe what kind of supports he got? I would say it was mostly just in understanding him and giving him more complete directions and more explicit of directions than they would give someone else because... I mean, it's a weird situation, it's a boss's kid. There was a lot of deference given I would say. Okay. Nothing... There was no one who came in who was a specific job coach? No. Okay. Great. And do you think that this summer job was a good fit for his skills and interests? No. They were more of a deterrent to show him what would happen if he doesn't get and education. Okay. Sorry, I'm typing. No worries. All right. Did he volunteer at all while he was in high school? He did. Okay. Where did he volunteer? He volunteered at the food pantry. I'm trying to think they're all through Scouts that he did. He did Feed My Starving Children many times. He did Hesed House. He did Loaves & Fishes. He sold candy for... Oh, what is the group home? It's escaping me right now. Anyway, he would do an annual candy sale and then through Scouts they had a lot of different programs that they volunteered with. Great. Okay. All right. That's it for during high school. Now thinking about the rest of the interview, I'm just going to ask you about academic programs, employment, and volunteering that he attended after high school. You've mentioned some of it already, but we're just going to go through piece by a piece. First, if we could just talk about, to get an idea of how he spends his time, can you tell me what a typical week looks like for Will and how he spends his time specifically with school programs, work, volunteering, all of that. Okay. Monday, Wednesday and Fridays Will works, and it's in a part-time situation, in the Chicago office at Aspiritech. He does quality assurance testing on Bose speakers whenever they do upgrades to make sure that they worked with everything. He does that typically. Now he's starting on a different project, which is 508 compliance for Department of Homeland Security. That's six hours of his day plus transportation. He gets on the bus outside of our house, takes to the train, goes to work and then reverses the whole process. And then in the evenings, he pretty much does chores. He runs, all of his self care, and he has some time to himself, which is typically watching TV or playing on the computer. Then on Tuesdays and Thursdays, he takes two classes at College of DuPag. Again, self care, I drive him. He tells me like, \"Oh, I have a meeting today with the navigator. I need to be there at 10:30.\" So I'm just around. I take him. And then he has his meetings, his classes, he comes home. Typically, he does his homework, mostly on Tuesdays and Thursday evenings and on the weekends. He doesn't have as much free time on those days. And then Saturdays and Sundays, he pretty much does chores and homework. He does some driving typically for practice. And then Sundays he has... Oh, I forgot. Let's see, Sundays he has the Stepping Up and Out group. But like I said, he only attends about a quarter of the time because they do things sometimes that aren't of interest to him. Okay. Is that the social group? Yes. It's a social group. It's through work and they usually take a five hour long social outing of some sort. They've gone to Ravinia before. They do comedy clubs. They've gone to a Japanese market. All kinds of things like that. Okay. And then Friday evenings, he does his Magic: The Gathering typically. He goes and games for three hours probably. Okay. And then Saturdays also, he does his Dungeons & Dragons group and that's usually two, two and a half hours. Okay. He's busy. Yeah. Sounds like a nice. He has a lot going on when I think about it. Yeah. Right, when actually say it out loud, he's got a nice, full, busy life. Okay. All right. Great. How would you say... Thinking about... He's in a post education program and he works for pay, how many hours altogether would you say does he spend not with the social stuff, but just with the job and school? Including transportation? Yes. Okay. That would be eight hours, that's 24 and then... You know what, let's not include transportation, actually. I'm so sorry. That's okay. I changed my mind. Let's do just actually when he's there. Okay. He works six hours a day. That's 18. And then at school, I would say it's four hours with the meetings and things like that added in, correct? Mm-hmm . Okay. That would be eight, so 26 in school and work. Okay, great. Thank you. Okay. Speaking... We're going to go, start current and we're going to move backwards. Let's talk about, he's at the College of DuPag currently. And then can you tell me a little bit about the program, you told me about the supports, but can you tell me how many hours a week he spends in class versus studying outside of class? What kind of certificate or degree he's going for, that kind of stuff. Okay. He is taking, I believe it is eight hours. He has one computer course and one speech class and they happen to be one right after the other so that's nice. He's got a five minute break in between. He probably spends somewhere between four, I would say eight hours because about four hours on each class, I would say outside of the class, unless he's working on his speech and then it's much more. Okay. All right. Thank you. And the program that he's in, he is doing a computer information systems program, not to get an Associates, but to transfer hopefully at some point to a four year institution. Okay. To transfer. Okay. Great. And then, you answered this one, one second, sorry. On average, does he usually take about two classes per semester? Typically? No. Okay. This was just to get his . He was taking a smaller load when he was a way at Rose-Hulman. He was taking about 14 to 16 hours, enough to stay full time, but definitely on the lower side for what the other kids were doing and relatively comparing him to the others. Our hope is that after this semester that he takes two to three classes this summer. And again, this is all up in the air because of what's going on. And then we would hope that he would be able to take maybe four classes in the fall. Okay. Thank you. Would you say he is full or part-time right now? Part time. Okay. All right. When did he start? Did he start this in August of this year? When did he start this program? The school program, he started in January. January, okay. And is he... You actually answered that for me already. And then in terms of... You talked about the different people who are providing supports at the college. Is he receiving any other types of supports, like modified curriculum? I don't know. Un-timed tests, any kind of modifications or accommodations? Yes. He has the ability to do that. I don't believe that he's taken any in... No, wait, that's wrong. He has taken a test in the accessibility office. Basically he had to go in and schedule a room and this is what they helped him with in the accessibility office, looking forward, do you have anything coming up? They helped him schedule, but he was on his own to communicate with the adjuster and get all those details working out. He does do that, it hasn't happened a lot. Okay, great. And any other comments about this particular program that he's in now that you want to add that we haven't talked about? No. it's just, this is just going... Technically the program that he's in, if you're being specific, is just something that's available to everybody else. As many things with Will go, we have work to customize within the framework of supports that are out there to get what he needs. Okay. There are supports that are available to everybody. It's just, we're really using them. Okay. Great. And then, let's talk about if we could, the school he attended before this one, what was the name of it? You've said it a few times, but I need to actually put it in now Okay. It's Rose, like the flower, hyphen Hulman, which is H-U-L-M-A-N. Okay. And it's an Institute of Technology. Okay, great. And what kind of a school was it? It's a four year engineering school. It's incredibly rigorous. It's very small. It's private. It's in Terre Haute, Indiana, which was a real drawback for me. It is... They do not have a specific autism program, even though they have a lot of students that are on spectrum. We were probably pushing the envelope with Will because his needs were greater probably than what they typically saw. Okay. And when he was there, about how many hours was he spending in class? You mentioned it before. I just want to make sure I get it exact. I would say it was between 12 and 14, depending on the quarter. They're on a quarter system. Okay. Ten week quarters. Okay. And what was his specific area study? Was it engineering? Yeah, he started up in mechanical engineering and then he immediate had some problems with doing hand drawings of things for a design class. He switched to just say computer engineering. I don't... I'm pretty sure that was the name of the program that he was in. Okay. And then 12 to 14 hours per quarter. Would that be three to four classes? Three classes? Yeah, three to four. Three to four, right? Mm-hmm . Okay. And that was full time? That was full time. Okay. And do you remember the month and year he started that program? He would've started that program in August 2016. Great. And then when did he leave, exactly? He left in November 2017. Okay. And so you left the program, can you give me a couple sentences of your thinking behind why he left the program? There was so much pressure that Will was starting to make choices that were inconsistent with what we know to be of him. He was cheating. He was freaking out and screaming at people and just behaviors that we hadn't seen. I know that it was just too much. He was just trying to do anything he could to survive, anything. Poor kid. Okay. And did he receive supports at all from this program? Again, there was no specific program as far as an autism program. I mean, obviously there was an accredited program for computer engineering, but we cobbled together services to get him what we thought he needed. There was an accessibility coordinator that worked with us and Will met with her once a week. He met with a counselor probably two times a month, and then he had tutoring every day for hours. But that's not atypical for students of the school that are freshman, sophomore years. Okay. Great. And is there anything that we didn't talk about with this particular school that you want to add? Yeah, I guess as far as the... I didn't really address the living situation. Okay. He had a lot of support. They have RAs that are very interactive. They have tutors that live on the floor with them, and then they also have something called Sophomore Assistance, which are just students who excelled in their freshman year and are very personable and kind of mentoring. There's a lot of mentoring that goes on. Okay. And I moved down there. Okay. Yeah. Because I just wasn't entirely sure how things were going to go. I mean, I was very involved and personal friends now with the Dean of students and the people in the cafeteria know me and know Will as a result, campus police, all these, I mean, we just tried to cover all of our bases. Okay, great. It's good to know. That's good information. Thank you. Well, it is. I was a lot. I'm sure. They liked me though. I would just like to put that on the record. They did like me. I'm putting it in there right now. I'm sure they did. No. I mean, very involved in trying to help. I love it. Are there any other schools that he attended after high school? No. Okay. Great. All right. Now thinking about jobs after high school. Okay. We know that he's current in a position, so you've told me the name. You don't need to say that one I've got, and you told me a little bit about what he does there, so you don't need to repeat that, but I know that there's supports already in place because it's a program or a job for people with autism. But can you describe if you know, of some of the supports, what they look like in action at his job? Yeah. They have a job coach who is dealing more with production and the interpersonal staff and... I'm trying to think, output and using some of the supports because they're on Slack, they have... I don't know, there's something that has a jobs program where it shoots out what tests are available. And so things like that. There's somebody that works with that. Then there's a technical lead who is someone who is working more with, \"Hey, I was running this test and this happened.\" And they are the interface between the worker, so Will, and either the person who's on the contract, who's the head of the contract, which would be the job lead or the company itself, depending on which contract he's working on. Okay. And then there's Human Resources who do... Will was on a performance improvement plan for his behavior. We worked with them on that. And that was mostly goal setting and monthly meetings. The other people he's in almost daily interactions with. And that's another thing that performance improvement plan was for, was to wean him from being like, \"Hey, I did this, is that okay?\" That he was constantly seeking approval. Okay. Yeah. There's that. And then there's the psychologist which he meets with, it may have changed frequency because he was at their main location at Highland Park, but he was traveling six hours a day to go there. Oh, boy. They've moved him to the Chicago office, which seems to be for more people that are more independent than perhaps Will was at the time that he started. I think that the psychologist goes back and forth between the two branches with maybe spending more time at Highland Park. I may be off and out, but I think it's once every two weeks he checks in. Okay. And those aren't necessarily formal. They might be a few minutes or when he was on a performance improvement plan, it was longer. Okay, great. And let's see, he is paid for this job. Yes. Correct? Okay. I feel like I didn't ask you that directly. Great. How did you find this place? How did he find this job? I just read about it in the newspaper and I called the woman who runs... I actually contacted her before we decided that Will was going to leave school. I called her and I'm like, \"Hey, We want him to have an internship. He doesn't have anything. And all the other kids at school are having an internship.\" And she's just an incredible person. And she was like, \"Hey, I don't know if we'll have anything, but here's what I would do. You might want to look into...\" And she mentioned a bunch of different companies. And then when our situation changed, I called her and she's like, \"We want to interview him, but we don't have any spots right now. What I'd like you to do is to have him work independently and try to get this 508 compliance through the Department of Homeland Security.\" Okay. And it's a very picky program they go through and they're checking application websites for the government to make sure that they're handicap accessible. There are like how many times a second something can flash? What colors? Can you access the speech to text? All these kinds of things that have prescribed things and it's very difficult to get apparently. I did not know that when Will started. Wow. There are people who've been programming for years who have a really hard time with this. He did get the certification. And then a couple months later, Aspiritech called and interviewed him and he started working for them. And do you remember when that was, the month and year that he started? I think it was June 2018. Okay. I could be wrong. All right. Great. And he works, you said on average, about 18 hours a week there, right? Yeah. Okay. He was working more. He was working 30 hours a week. And then when he started College of DuPag in January, he went back to 18. Okay. Great. And sorry, I just got to finish that... Great. Has he participated in any other employment or volunteering after high school? Let me think about this. No. Okay, great. All right. That one is done. Thank you. Great. I need five minutes to run to the bathroom and then we'll go over the goals and then we'll call Will back in and that'll be our last part. Okay. If you don't mind, I'll be right back. I'm just going to-\n",
            "finishThat's weird. My screen is like not here. Okay, good. That scare me. This seems like my screen's frozen. Yeah. Okay. So now we go on, the next session is about his high school. Okay. So you told me that Luke will exit his high school in June 2020. May In May. Oh, wait. Oh, I'm sorry, wait. He will finish high school in May 2022. Two, yes. 2022, yes. Okay. Okay. Is Luke currently working? Not full-time, part-time. Part-time. How many job is Luke currently working? Just one. Just one does Luke receive payment at this job? Yes. Okay. Do you mind telling me where Luke work? Oh, Goodwill, Goodwill Industries a thrift store. Goodwill. And this one is in like, I think it's in Glenview. I have to look to see the exact address. It's a weird spot. I think, yeah. That's good, Goodwill is good. Yeah. Does Luke work at school? No. So how did Luke find this job? Through a job coach. So how many hours a week on average does Luke work at this job? Okay. Let me think, three, six, nine. Nine hours per week about. What  year did Luke begin his job? Well, I would say, I think it was August or late July, 2021. Late July. 2021. So is this job part of school programming? No, not at all. Can you tell me a little about the job? Like job title and duty? I think he's a book scanner and they sell books in the stores and he helps categorize them. He puts them in a certain category. Oh, it's cookbooks that goes over here and this bin, they do it that whatever. Maybe they ship it to other stores. All the scanning would be done in this one store, so. Does Luke receive support while working? I don't know. I don't think, maybe a little. I don't know. No, I don't think so. Okay. Do you think this job is a good fit for Luke's skill and interest? Somewhat, yeah. Wow. Do you mind telling me why? I think that he finds it, he's in the back, not with people and he just scans books. Now the problem we've run into is that he's a little interested, he likes to read the books a little bit. So that can be distracting and reduces his productivity. So, yeah and they've talked to him and we've talked to him about that too, so. But that is a good thing though, he loved to read the books. Yeah, he's very curious about the books. Okay. So has Luke worked and left any jobs since May 18, 2021. Oh no, no. He just, one job only and this is his first job. Has Luke volunteer in the community during high school since last time we talked? In the community? Boy Scouts, he is a Boy Scout. And also through school, he worked he volunteers through school. He's required to through school and he doesn't have different requirements. All the kids age have the same requirements. They have to do so many hours of service so he has to do that. So he has to, yeah. So usually how many hours he need to be volunteer required ? I think, I don't know. I think it's like 20. I could find out for you. Yeah. We can just estimate would be good. Around 25 hours per week? Yeah. 25 per the whole year, I think. 25. Yeah and I know that they've made adjustments to it because of COVID. It's more difficult to find opportunities maybe in the community, but the school has them, so they do that at school. Or through Boy Scouts, oftentimes his friends will have a project that they need to have done, so. Okay. All right. Thank you. So now we are going to the last section. Okay. It's about the goal we set last year. Okay. Okay. Let me go for this. During the first visit, we set three annual goals with you and Luke. The purpose of this goal development was to support family in helping Luke to pursue his dream for the future and really start working on these goals. Okay.\n",
            "finish...discussed some activities Chandler had been involved in, we would love to hear what he is doing now. You said Chandler is no longer in high school and that he did graduate since the last time we spoke on May 20th. Right. Technically it wasn't high school. It's what they call a transition program, is if they technically graduate from high school at the typical age of 18, and then, the next four years, it's considered a transition program. He graduated from the transition program. He's not doing that anymore. He did just start this season of Special Gifts Theater. He's doing that. He's occasional volunteer work at Feed My Starving Children. Okay. Give me just a second. We're going to get to that in one moment. Oh, okay. When he graduated from the transition program, was that June 2021? Yeah. June 22nd, 2021. Okay. Now, for this section, I'm going to ask you about the academic programs and employments and volunteering activities that he's completed since the last time we spoke. What does a typical week look like for Chandler? Also, thank you for being flexible. I just didn't want to miss any questions again. Yeah, no, no, no. That's fine. A typical week is pretty much mainly at home, mainly somewhere between. He does the dishes. He helps with household chores. He usually will take a walk, and we usually run errands. Then, maybe once a week, he'll go and do volunteer activities. But it's pretty much around the house without a whole lot of extra activities at this time. Okay. Okay. Volunteering in the community. About how many hours total during the week does Chandler spend participating in all of these vocational educational activities, I think, in this case, specifically, referring to the volunteering in the community? Probably about two hours a week, two or three hours a week. Now, we're going to talk about school programs that Chandler attended after high school. Is Chandler currently enrolled, or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college, college, or university? No. Okay. He still currently volunteers, correct? Yes. Okay. Can you repeat to me the name of the company/agency that he volunteers at? Feed My Starving Children. Okay. Then, can you describe the activity? What does Chandler do at this program? He measures and packages non-perishable foods and packs it to be sent to regions of impoverishment. Okay. Does Chandler receive supports while participating? Yes. Okay. What types of supports? Once he learns the activities, he needs someone to ask questions. He needs somebody to show him what to do. Once he knows what to do, he's pretty good on his own. He just needs somebody periodically to reference if he runs out of material or whatever. Once trained, minimal oversight required. Okay. Is or was Chandler paid in this activity? No. Okay. How did Chandler find this activity? Through his stepmother and his father? You said about two hours a week. Do you remember the month and year that Chandler started this activity? I would say probably August or September of 2021. I'd say September of 2021. Okay. Was this activity a good fit for Chandler's skills and interests? Yes. Okay. Why? Why? Mm-hmm . He's extremely task-oriented. He tends to like smaller tasks that he can do in quantity quickly. Okay. If you have any- Very specific instructions around it, not a lot of wiggle room. Okay. Do you have any additional comments about this program or any additional circumstances you would like to explain about that program? No. We like it because we like him to understand that volunteering and doing good for others is important. We don't know exactly how much he understands of that element of it. But we do want him to understand that volunteerism should be part of his life. That's part of it. Then, the other thing is just the activity of it is very good because, as I said, it's very specific, not a lot of variability. Then, third is the sociability. There are other people there. He can interact with other people. Despite his communication deficits, he's a pretty social kid. That's the other thing that's been really hard with COVID is the isolation. It's been very hard on him. Yeah. Is he currently participating in any other vocational employment or volunteering activities? No. Okay. Okay. I feel like the Jeopardy playing Maybe Me. Kind of. It even has a little circle for me. I'm like, \"Okay. It's time.\" I know you're thinking. I get it. At least it's working, though, so I can't complain. Great.\n",
            "finishThe next portion, it'll be a vocational inactivity index. So last time you spoke, we would share some activities that Caroline had been involved in and we would love to hear more about what she's doing. From what you've shared with me, she's currently still in high school, in the transition program. Is that correct? Yeah, she'll age out. At Illinois, they put in a lot to be at the end of the school year. Okay. So this is her last year, then? Yes. Was she excited to be able to see through the school year following her 22nd birthday? I don't think it matters to her. I think she's pretty well done. They changed the structure and they have... There's just some disruptive kids and things, so she tends not to go five days a week. She'll just go three days. Okay. Is she currently working? They're trying her out, so she's not getting paid. Has she worked or left any jobs since early May, the last time we spoke or the last time you talked to somebody on our team? Yeah. So she just did an internship and that was unpaid. Where was the internship located or where was it at? It was a bakery called Spilled Milk in Oak Park. Yes. Oh, that's a really great name for a bakery. I love that. Could you tell me a little bit about this internship experience? So where did she get it? I'm trying to remember. I think she emailed them and she has her food safety manager certification already, so they were interested in that. And, so they brought her on for the summer and when... The owner just taught her how to do the bakery stuff, but didn't ask her to stay on. So that's why we're trying with the job coach to see where the holes are. Okay. And I know you just shared more about where those opportunities are for continued learning. Do you feel like the job was a good fit or this internship was a good fit? I thought it was, but we don't know... Again, they didn't ask her to stay on, but yet they're still looking for workers, so not sure what happened. I think it's production rates, but I'm not sure. Okay. So my next question would be what her reason was for leaving. So she wasn't asked to leave, correct? They did say that it would just be for the summer. So then it was like, \"Okay, first week of August is going to be your last time.\" Outside of the internship, has she done any volunteering in the community during high school since last time you spoke? Yeah, so we were doing it together. We were volunteering for the Animal Care League, and we were taking food from the food pantry, and then transporting it to the Animal Care League. So when people picked up food for their animals, they could also pick up food for themselves. That's great. So we do that once a week, every Thursday for eight months, I think. That's a great opportunity as well. Such a great idea. Yeah, it was really fun. Is there a part of the volunteering that Caroline enjoyed the most? Yeah, she really liked it. She really looked forward to doing that. Wonderful. Okay. This next portion is about the goals that you set 12 months ago. So the goal of this follow up is to collect the highest level of attainment data that Caroline received over the year and how she's been working on it. And, so during that first visit, there were three goals set, and the purpose was to support you in helping her to pursue her dreams for the future, and start working on those goals. And now that a year is past, we'd like to check in and see how she's been doing. And we feel that it is important to say that we understand that this last year has been very unpredictable, given COVID, so we know that could have impacted how you've worked on these goals. So the first goal was that, within one year, by referring...\n",
            "finishYes. About how many jobs did she have? She had three, well, I guess one was two summers of the same job, so two different jobs. Okay. And has she ever had a job that was part of a high of high school programming? I don't think so. Yeah. You know what? She did. I think they had her just selling snacks and stuff. Okay. And has she been paid at any of her jobs during high school? She got paid two out of the three. Okay. And can you tell me sort of either the most current job where she worked. Can we talk about that one or where she worked the longest? I'm just going to ask you a few more questions about that job, whichever one you picked. Yes. So she worked two summers at a, it was a French bakery called, Sugar Fixe. Okay. Sugar fix. Does it have an E at the end of the X? Is it F-I-X-E? Yes. Okay. Like Fixe, I think. I feel like I've seen it before or maybe my mind just, I don't know. Okay. And how did you find it? Yeah, so I actually arranged it for her. She said she wanted to work at a bakery for a summer, and this was like, I think junior, no junior of high school. And so I just through Facebook community group, just put an email out there saying that, \"Hey, does anybody know anybody at a bakery?\" She could help out at, and this woman responded who owned Sugar Fixe, and was nice enough to, the first summer was just more like an internship kind of thing. And then the second summer they paid her and then now COVID has decided... The summer we didn't even approach her, because I mean, the fact whether this business is going to survive or not, I mean... Right. It's hard to approach people to ask for employment right now. It's hard to know really like what to do protocol wise with anything really. But yeah, exactly. I mean, looking for a job, trying to get a job is really difficult. So this summer she is- Yeah. Okay. She's not working. Okay, great. And about how many hours a week did she work at Sugar Fixe? It wasn't many. I think it was four hours total. So two maybe, or maybe not. I'm trying to think how much it was. It might have been like two and a half and a half. Maybe five total a week. Okay. So two days a week? Yeah. Okay. And do you remember around what month and year she began working at this job? I guess we could say for the second summer, was that then June, May? So it would be June of 2018. Thanks. Okay. And then June of 2019. Okay. All right. And let's see. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about the job sort of what her duties were at the job? Yeah. So she would pour cake batter into the molds. She would make the batter, she would decorate croissants, on and I'm trying to figure out else she did. She would fill the macaroons, they're really known for the macaroons. Okay. So she did a lot of hands on work in terms of creating the bake goods. Was she mostly in the kitchen then? Yeah. Yeah. She didn't do... I don't really see her doing like counter kind of stuff. She's more like a behind the scene's kind of person. Great. And did she receive any support while she was working? So it was interesting, the first week, so the kitchen is extremely small in the first week, so the school gave support, but then Sugar Fixe was like, \"We don't want them here.\" They didn't feel that they had any value and they just didn't... they're like, \"I don't know what you're paying for these people if you're, but we don't want them here. And I just want you to know, if you're paying for them, they're just not great.\" Really? Okay. Yeah. So- So, oh, was it- People that were- Go ahead. I'm sorry. I mean, one of them was like, the OPRF has their own state person or I think they're from DRS, but I'm not sure. Okay. And so it was like that person, I guess he was on his phone the entire time. Oh, yeah. And the place is very small. Right. So he's taking up a customer seat just being there on his phone. They were not happy. No, that's interesting. So OPRF has their own voc rehab people then, their own job coaches through DHS? Well, they have one medicated person to help find employment. And I think that person was a person that stepped in as the job coach. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then I think they might have like their own internal job coaches within OPRF. Right. So we haven't assessed... The job coach is plus or minus. Right. Because if you heard me talk with Janice, it's like, she's waiting to be prompted. And so if you have a job coach, that's kind of what they're doing along the way is prompting. But it's hard. I haven't figured out how the job coach can be used successfully with helping her. I think there is a way. I just don't know how. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Maybe some sort of, fading supports. Yeah. She's looking for that prompt, I'm just thinking, go ahead. Yeah. I think that's kind of what the most successful job coach I've heard is somebody working alongside. So she can look over and see, having that ability to look over and say, \"Oh, that's what I should be doing right now.\" Yeah. That's good. Right. So modeling for her what they're doing. Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Do you think that the job at Sugar Fixe was a good fit for Carly's skills and interests? I think so. I mean, I have an email because they asked if she could stand for the fall and this is so this is when times were great, and they're just like, \"No, we really can't.\" And so I had her transition teacher just reach out to them to say, \"Hey, we're working at Job Skills.\" She worked there. Is there's stuff she can work on rather than a parent saying, \"Why won't you hire my kid?\" And so they put nice emails together saying, \"We know she's capable of doing X, Y, Z, but she there's a tray that's empty and she just let it sit there and then we'd have to stop everything we're doing and then tell her to set her up to the next job.\" Okay. So she was waiting, like you were talking about, she was waiting for someone to kind of point out and tell her that she should. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And did Carly volunteer at all during high school in the community? She was... I'm trying to think when she volunteered. I think maybe it was like freshman year, she volunteered at the library. So that was a summer thing too. She had an ABA therapist too helping her along. Okay. What kinds of things did she do there? Do you remember? It was sorting books and setting up displays. Okay, great. That's it for this one. So that was easy. Thank you.\n",
            "finishSo, next, we're going to go through some information about sort of how Caden spends his day. So, first I'm going to ask you to describe Caden's current high school situation. He will be starting high school in person, his senior year, next week. Okay. And did anything about Caden's high school track or plans change since the last time we spoke? I can't remember what I said, but I don't think so. Okay. And when is Caden planning on exiting high school? Next, next year. 20, 22. Next year? Yeah. So in like June of 20, 22? Yeah. Well, I should say high school, but then we do plan on staying in the transitions program. Okay. And how long do you plan on staying in transition program, at least for now? Probably until 21. Although I will... I think I will explore other options as well. Okay. So he's... He'll be 18, this, this spring. Is that right? He'll be 18 this, this year in December. So 20, 20, I'm trying to figure out... I have to enter the year that he's planning on exiting. So if he'll be 21,  when he leaves, that would be another three years. Yes. Yeah. Great. 25, yeah, 22, 25. 25, I think that's right. Okay. And you said that Caden's currently working at  Cinemas? Yeah. And is that the... That's the one job he has. Does he have additional jobs right now? Just that job. Okay. And is he receiving payment for that job? Yes. Okay. And this is I'm guessing a community job, not an in-school job. Correct. Great. And how did he find that job? Well, I would say he had help with, with DVR, but he always wanted to work there, so he applied. Okay. And I believe you said earlier, he works about 18 hours a week there on average. Yes. And do you remember the month and year that he started that job? When things started  obligated, so April, April of this year. And is this job at all connected to his school programming? No. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about what he does at that job? He's an usher. So he... He does cleaning and then customer service for . And does he receive support while working? Typically, no. He has access to a job coach when he's learning new tasks- Mm-hmm . But day to day he doesn't have support. Okay. And then, sorry, it's giving, me, just a little bit of trouble. Okay. And do you think that this job is a good fit for Caden's skills and interests? Yes. Okay. And why do you say that? Because he's always wanted to work there, and he likes movies. Hmm. And he worked at . Is that right? Volvo's Pizza? Yeah. Yes. And that was in the community, right? Correct. And how did he find that job? That was through DVR,  employment agency, or vocational services. Yeah. And do you remember the month and year that he started that job? I am so terrible with dates. I don't. He... He had been there about two years, I think it was... Okay, so 20, 21... Let's just say January, 2019. Okay. And then do you remember when he stopped working at that job? That was about May of 20, 21. And could you tell me a little bit about what he did at that job? He did cleaning stuff there, dishes, garbage, tear down. And did he receive any support while working at that job? He had access to it, but no. Okay. And you said he worked about two to four hours a week at that? Yeah. Great. And then he left the job because the business folded. Right? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear your response on that one. Can you hear me? Yes. So you said he- Yeah, sorry . He left that job because- Yes. He... He left because it's closed. Okay. And did you think that that job was a good fit for Caden's skills and interests? Yeah, he liked it. And has he done any volunteer work in the community since last time we spoke? Probably not since the last time we spoke. He's done volunteer work, but I don't think during the COVID period. No. Okay. Great. Anything else that you wanted to tell us about or any other updates that you wanted to share? Not that I can think of. Okay. And then I just want to confirm we still have the right contact information for you. So we've been emailing about this appointment. Is that still the best email? Yes. And have you moved or otherwise changed your mailing address? No. Great. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today as this would not be possible without your participation. And that's the end of the check-in. Okay, great. Thank you. Sorry for the spotty connection. No problem. Have a good rest of your day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.\n",
            "finishSo that completes the second of three forms. I'm going to move on to our last and final form here. Okay. Okay. Please describe Ali's high school situation. Is she still in high school or receiving services through the school system? Yeah, she  and she has an IEP. Did Ali's high school track plans change since we last spoke? Yes. They took out one of the requirements for math that most students have to complete and they had her do an alternate math track. And when is Ali planning on exiting high school? Well, graduation would be May of 2022. And then she would have two years of the 18 to 21 program. Is Ali currently working, you spoke to this in the beginning? Yes. The Dunkin Donuts. And then, does Ali have any additional jobs beyond Dunkin? No. Does Allie receive payment at this job? Yes. Okay. Does Ali work at school? Is this on campus or in the community, off campus? In the community off campus. Okay. And how did she find this job? The DVR helped with the process. And how many hours a week on average does Ali work at Dunkin? Five hours a week. And what month and year did Ali begin working this job? November of 2020. And is this job part of school programming? No. And then, can you tell me a little bit about this job? The job titles or duties that Ali holds? She mostly works in the kitchen. And does food prep, sanitizing and washing dishes. And does Ali receive support while working? Not currently. Okay. And do you think this job is a good fit for Ali's skills and interests? Yes. Okay. And speak more to that please. I think this is a good stepping stone for her into working at a job. She has a supportive work environment. Her manager and employees are accepting and helpful. So I think being at a job where she feels comfortable with her coworkers is good for her. Makes her feel good about working. Okay. Has Ali worked and left any jobs since March 9th, 2020? Yes. She had a internship at a horse stable from June of 2020 to September of 2020. Okay. Did Ali receive payment at this internship? Yes. And what is the name of the place that she worked... Or the internship/worked? Bristol Equestrian Estates. The first one. Was it crystal? Bristol. B as in boy as in boy. Okay. And was this part of school or the community? Just community. Okay. And how did Ali find this opportunity? DVR. How many hours a week on average did she work at this job? About three and a half. And could you tell me a little bit about this job, such as job titles or duties? She cleaned horse stalls. And helped with any outdoor duties that needed to be done, such as picking weeds or helping with hay or something? She didn't work directly with the horses. Okay. And did Ali receive support while working? Yes. And the type and amount of support Ali had at this job? She had a job coach about half of the time that she was there. So if she worked for four hours, a job coach would work with her for two. It was a faded number of hours as the internship progressed. Okay. And what was Ali's reason for leaving this job or internship? It was just the internship ended. There was an end date to the internship. Do you think this job was a good fit for Ali's skills and interests and why or why not? No, because the employer didn't communicate very well. If Ali needed extra help, they didn't let us know that she wasn't being successful in her duties without a job coach. So since job coaching is supposed to be dated, she wouldn't have been able to have been provided full-time job coaching by DVR, had she stayed as a permanent employee. So, therefore, the internship ended because she needed more assistance than they would've been able to provide. I don't know if that makes sense. Yeah, I got that all down. Okay. Okay. So with this internship, the end date... I guess I'm trying to better understand so I can mark this more clearly. So the reason for leaving was that there was an end date. And then I have here in the notes that DVR wouldn't support the full-time work. Right. Right. Because they weren't able to keep her on as a full-time employee. Because DVR wouldn't have been able to provide a full-time job coach. And they said, given the duties, they would've wanted her to have a full-time job coach. Thank you for everything. Yeah. Sorry. So at Dunkin Donuts I think she can do more on her own. Whereas at the stable, they felt she wasn't able to do as much on her own. Okay. And has Ali volunteered in the community during high school since the last time we spoke? Has she done what? Volunteering in the community? No. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates you want to share? No, she turns 18 in June and so she will be switching over to adult services. We've been told she qualifies for adult services. She already had her functional screening. So we're just waiting for that next step. Okay. Thank you so much for taking this time to talk with us today. An assist would not be possible without your participation. And right before we end, I want to make sure that our email address is up to date. As well as the mailing address, as you mentioned a move. What is a good email address for you? Hawkisam@yahoo.com. I think that's the one I've been receiving emails at. Great. And then the mailing address. Let's see. Should I put it in the chat or should I say it? Whatever's easiest for you. If you do put it in the chat, I am able to get it. Okay. Let's see. Okay. I'll do my email to make sure you have that. And then... Alright, excellent. I'm going to copy those over right now. That was a really great idea. Thanks for proposing. That is much easier. Right. Alright. I have 1270 Stonewood Crossing number 1201, Sun Prairie Wisconsin, 53590. Right? Great. That completes today's interview and 5:15. Perfect timing. Great. So thank you so much Samantha for meeting with us today. I hope you have a good rest of your week. Thank you. You too. Bye. Bye-Bye\n",
            "finishSo I think they're wrapping up. There was one point where a branch came down right outside my window. It was a little strange. Okay. Almost there. Okay, so last time we spoke, we discussed some activities that Tate had been involved in, and we'd love to hear what he's doing now. So we'll start by talking about high school, even though I know we already talked about it. Just to confirm one more time, is Tate receiving any services through high school? No. The school system at all now? Okay. No. No longer. And because I know that we said that he got his diploma during COVID time, so did anything about his track or his plans change in that time, since last time we spoke before he got that diploma? Okay. Mm-mm . And do you remember what month and year he exited high school? So I guess it would be last May. Last May. Okay, so 2020? Or June. June, he got his diploma, but he hadn't been going for months. Well, a lot of months before that. Yeah. Okay. So he got his diploma June 2020, but hadn't been going for months before. That's just when he got the diploma. Okay. And what type of diploma did Tate receive? Regular education. Okay, great. Which is crazy because he's never written a paper or anything. He's never been in a traditional classroom, but yet they gave him a regular diploma, regular ed. Okay. So for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask you about academic programs, employment and volunteering activities that Tate has done since March 2020 when we last spoke. So first, I just want to get an idea of how Tate usually spends his time. So let's talk about, what does typical week look like for Tate? How is he spending his time? So Monday through Friday mornings, he gets picked up by Mad City Mobility and takes him to Turning Point where he attends the classes. And I think he's done by, I think, noon. And then they will transport him on Monday, Wednesday and Friday to his job that he does from 1:00 to 3:00. And then transportation will pick him up on those days and take him back to his apartment. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he gets picked up, I think, just afternoon and goes back to his apartment. And he's got therapy on Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons for an hour each. Let's see, he's got people from Options for sure Monday, Tuesdays and Fridays. Those are the absolute days that we know we're going to have somebody from 4:00 to 7:00. And they will help him do grocery shopping and just try to boost his mood and companionship type things, go for a walk. And then weekends and the evenings that he does not have anybody and weekends is my husband and I. Okay. Just to make sure, because I was typing and listening at the same time, so I want to make sure I got it right, you said therapy was Tuesdays and Thursdays, is that right? Yes. Okay, great. Just making sure I got it. So it sounds like he's both working in the community, right? Mm-hmm . Without any sort of supports. And that he's also doing an education program with Turning Point? Yes. Would you call it an education program? Okay. I call it a transition program. Yeah. Okay. So combining those Turning Point hours with work, how many hours a week do you think he's spending on those vocational and educational activities? Let's see, three hours, 15 plus six. 21 hours. Okay. So now I'm going to talk about school programs that Tate might have attended after high school. So is Tate currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, a community college, college or university since March of 2020. No. And he didn't attend one in between and just finished it off? Okay, great. No. So now, I'm going to talk about jobs and programs, beginning with his most recent job and working back to the last time we spoke. So I know Tate currently has a job in the community. Let me just click my boxes. And you'll have to remind me of the name of the place where he's working right now. It's MOX, M-O-X and then Mania, M-A-N-I-A. Okay. And I know you described it a little bit to me, but sorry, my notes are now in a different place, so you can tell me one more time about all Tate does at MOX Mania. I call it a nerd game store. It's a Dungeons and Dragons kind of store, and he pulls cards for orders because they call them trading cards, but they're game cards. Or when they get shipments in, he files them all in alphabetical order. Okay. Okay. And he is paid for that job? Yes. And how did Tate find that job? We found it for him. Do you remember how you found it? It was a store that we had taken him to and he just thought it was so cool. And the owner was really nice, so we just asked the owner, \"Do you ever need some help, and would you be open?\" And he did. I think he did a job shadow there for a couple of months and then he was hired on as a regular employee. But he's got a couple of big breaks in there, but the owner always takes him back. Great. And how many hours a week does Tate do just at this job then? Six hours a week. Six. Okay. And do you remember the month and year when he first started working at that job? Geez, I don't. Okay. Do you remember maybe just the year? Probably 2019. Okay. Do you maybe remember- You can say October of- Okay. I was going to say, maybe if you remember the season, if not the month. Yeah, I think it was fall. Okay. Would you say that that job is a good fit for Tate's skills and interests? It is for interests, and it works with his anxiety. But it's definitely not taking advantage of the skill level. Any additional comments about this job or anything you want to elaborate on about that? Mm-mm . Okay. And then, has he participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since March 2020? No. Great. Anything else you'd like to tell us or any other updates that you want to share? No. So I just have to make sure that I have your email and mailing address correct. So I know I've been emailing with you. Is that email correct? Yes. And has your mailing address changed at all? No. Okay. So thank you so much for taking time to talk with us today. Assist would not be possible without your participation. You're all done. Well, thanks. It was painless and it makes me think about how much we have to be grateful for. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Great. Well, thank you so much for talking to me today, Didi. And I'll let you go have a good rest of your day. Sure. Thank you, Molly. Sorry about earlier. Thanks. Not a problem. All right, bye. Take care. Bye-bye.\n",
            "finishLast time we spoke, well, last night when you spoke with someone else on our team, you discussed some activities Zach had been involved in. We would love to hear what Zach is doing now. We'll start by talking about his high school experience. And it sounds like Zach is not in high school anymore, correct?  Correct. Okay. So is he still receiving any services through the school system at all? Not currently, no. Okay. All right.  He got his diploma in '15. Okay. Do you remember what month that was? May. Okay. What type of diploma did Zach receive, is that a regular diploma, occupational diploma, certificate of completion? Anything like that? Oh, it was a regular high school diploma. He chose to go the additional year. He qualified, so he chose to do so. Okay, sounds great. All right. So for the rest of the interview I'm going to ask you about academy programs, employment, and volunteering activities that Zach attended since May 13, 2020. So first I'd like to get an idea of how Zach usually spends his time. Let's talk about the activities he participates in during a typical week. So, during a typical week, what does that look like for Zach? How has he been spending his time? So, what he normally does, he gets up by 7:00 every day. He's in to work by 8:30. And his average day is until between 4:00 and 5:00.  he's done with work, he usually helps me feed and take care of the deer herds that we own.  Oh, cool. And then we usually eat supper. I'm a recovering alcoholic and I go to meetings when it isn't the pandemic, and a lot of times he'll come with me. He enjoys that very much. And then he usually, if it's a school night, watch You Tube on his laptop until it's time to get ready for bed, and then he'll go to bed. Sounds like a very fruitful day. In there, there's elderly people he helps with things. They have trouble lifting and he assists them, like emptying their letter box, taking out their trash, that type of thing, and it's not as such a schedule, just happens when they give him a call. And he's more than happy to... Only he started doing a new thing last year, he didn't like the way the street looked, one of the main drags in Janesville, Milton Avenue? Mm-hmm . That's where his employer's at. And so he goes on his own out there and picks up trash on the sidewalks and stuff, just because he wants to, it's like a community service thing he thought up on his own. And all we ask him is, \"Please don't do it after dark.\" And so he'll pick up trash, maybe 10 buckets of trash, and fill them in containers. And a lot of the business... he'll do it for Wendy's and they'll buy him supper. Oh, wow, that's... Then he got recognized by the city for doing it, somebody noticed it and he got a letter of accommodation, and a couple of pins from the city to wear on his lapel, for his community service. He's quite proud of that, he started doing that last summer. Wow, that's great to hear. He sounds like a very kind-hearted little guy. Yeah, he likes to call himself The Gentle Giant, that's what his grandma calls him- Ah. ... so he sticks to that. That is so cute. Man, that sounds great. And it's great that the city is recognizing his services. Yeah, if he has a lull in his day he always has something he wants to go do. And he's the kind of person that can't do nothing without telling me every specific thing about it. And so I don't even have to ask, \"Where are you going, what are you doing?\" I get told it, he informs me. \"Is that okay?\" I say, \"Heck, yeah.\" That's great. He's pretty responsible. Yeah, he is. I mean, I know a lot of young men his age who's not as responsible as Zach is, from what I'm hearing. I wasn't. So it sounds like he's currently working for pay. Is that a independent job? Or is he working with some support? Nope, independent job. Great. Okay. So how many total hours during the average week does Zach spend participating in all of these vocational activities? So you mentioned- Oh, like today he's helping somebody move, and he'll go out and pick up trash until it's dark tonight. So probably 30, 40 hours a week he'll do that. Right, okay. Along with his job already. Right, because his job will already take about 36, 38 hours? Yeah. Cool. So did Zach attend any school programs after he graduated high school? No. Okay. So, he's not doing any of those classes you mentioned since May, correct? No. Okay. So let's talk, dive more into details of Zach's job. Let's first talk about the work for pay independently. Do you know the name of the company, or the business that he's working for? Yep, it's Boucher Hyundai, in Janesville. A car dealership. Can you spell the name again for me? B-O-U-C-H-E-R. Okay, all right. So it sounds like Zach generally works with cars, but could you describe in more details about the type of work Zach does with cars? Yeah, he details them, he cleans them inside and out, makes them showroom ready for customers. And the other responsibility of the job is to make sure the lot is always picked up and clean. In the winter he does shoveling, and scrapes all of them with the snow blower, and that's all part of his job along with detailing cars. Okay. I remember you told me that he's not currently receiving any support for this job, right? No. Okay. How did Zach find this job? It's a funny, long story, I'll give you the short version. Sure. It was a rainy night, and my dad at the time was in full dementia before he passed away. And every night we went to go give him his medicine. And we were on our way to go there, and he was driving his truck, and he was going to meet me there. And where he was at, is right across the street from Boucher, and he pulled up in the intersection and this big semi came along and wanted to make a turn there. Well, the person behind him wouldn't back up, so he could back up and give the truck room. So he nosed out and went to go across the street so the truck could turn, and here was coming another vehicle getting ready to T-bone him. So he stood on the gas to get across the street and hit two cars in the car lot. Oh, no.  To avoid having the other guy and him get in an accident. Oh, no.  And so I get called over there, and the truck driver took off and the police ticketed Zach. Oh. So he felt so bad about hitting the cars in the car lot, he kept going back every day with doughnuts and stuff for them, and the manager there says, \"You're here so much I might as well give you a job. Do you know how to do anything?\" Oh. He said, \"Well, I can detail cars.\" He said, \"Can you start tomorrow?\" And that's how he got his job. Oh, wow, that is such a heartwarming story, it should end up on the news. And the cars that he hit, the guys were tickled that he hit his car, because he was trying to get to of the lease on it. Well now it's totaled, so he's out of the lease. Oh, wow. So he's an instant friend.  Wow. He didn't try to do that, it just happened. Wow, again, good heart Zach got rewarded because of his good heart.  He was working part-time 20 hours a week, and then he was doing such a good job they gave him a dollar an hour raise and put him on full-time. Yeah, that's wonderful. Do you remember what year that was? Yeah, that was '05. No, it was 2017. Okay. Do you remember the month? Yep, it was end of April. So it sounds like this is a really good fit for Zach, because he really likes working with cars, and it sounds like it fits his skills? Mm-hmm . Any other reasons why this is a good fit for Zach? The support staff there, the people he works with, it's not a big company where you're just a number, everybody's like family, because you have technicians, salespeople, managers. And the guy that's in charge of all the Boucher dealerships in Janesville, is a friend of mine from years ago. And he likes Zach. I mean, Zach got me a job there. Oh, wow. Yeah, he had me fill out an application, against my better judgment, and I turned it in, and I didn't hear nothing for a year. All of a sudden they needed drivers, and Zach mentioned it to the guy I'd known for years, and he said, \"Yeah, why isn't your dad working here?\" Before you know it, I was driving. You must be so proud? Oh, I am. Yeah, you should be. He just keeps making us look good all the time. Yeah. Then I always tell him, I brag on him, and then he pulls a boner, and then I have to reevaluate my thinking, \"Why did you do that?\" I says, \"I pay compliments to you, and then you pull a dandy.\" But I say, \"You're normal, your dad can't multitask well either.\" So, let's talk a little bit about the volunteering job that Zach has been doing in the community. I guess, it doesn't sound like he's receiving any support for those activities he's doing, he just started it on his own, and received recognition for it, right? Correct, somebody recognized what he was doing, and brought it to the attention of the city council, and they decided to recognize him for it. Okay, that sounds great. I'm assuming this is not paid, correct? No. He does this on his own time because he wants to. How many hours per week does Zach participate in this activity, on average? I'd say probably about 10. Do you remember when he started doing this? Yeah, it was last year during the pandemic, he wanted to do something outside, because the weather was getting nice, so it'll be about this time last year, it was right around his birthday, April 8th. He said, \"I just feel like doing something.\"  Absolutely. So one day he took off walking and I didn't see him, 8:00 at night and it was getting dark and I called, \"Where the heck are you?\" And he was 12 blocks away. And I said, \"Would you mind coming home? It's getting dark.\" I says, \"I'm not worried about you doing anything wrong, it's some crazies that are out there.\" And he goes, \"Sure thing, dad.\" So I didn't hear from him for 20 minutes, so I couldn't take it, I went looking for him and he was about four blocks away, he was heading home. So what he does now, he has his own vehicle, he'll drive his truck out there to a vacant lot, and Janesville Police Department, they cruise by and make sure nobody messes with his truck while he's doing his thing. We need more Zachs in our city. I think we do. Yeah, we do. I think we do. So other than these two activities, his main job and the volunteering activity, and occasional volunteering for the elderly, is there any other activities he's participating in that we haven't covered? Well he's my right-hand man, and every time I need help... I was sick through most of '17 and '18, in long-term care. And when I came home I didn't have the strength to hardly do anything, so he helped me with my deer, also my deer herd. And we do constant maintenance out there, like poles for the fence and stuff like that. That's as I need it, he's always made himself available to help me repair. Absolutely. So he will help with managing the deer herd and- Excuse me? He helps with the deer herd that your family owns, and he does some- Correct. ... extra work, will help with elderlys occasionally? Since my parents died I got full ownership of them, so if I need muscle, he's my man. Sounds great. So how many hours does he do this type of family work with you, on average? Oh, at least eight hours a week. It depends on the project, but I would average about eight hours a week. And when did this start, do you remember? When did this start? Yeah, helping out with the deer business? Oh, when he was about three. Oh, okay. My parents owned the herd when he was born, and he's always been part of the deer pen as soon as he could walk or crawl, the deer accepted him right away. And do you remember what year that was when he was three? Oh, let's see, he was born in... probably '97, '98. Yeah, '97, '98. Does he like this job? He followed my dad around, his grandpa, all over the place. And wherever grandpa and Zach went, the deer weren't too far behind. Great. Does he like hanging out with the deer? Loves it. He's my PR guy. If young people come out there, or parents with little kids, he takes them right in there. Oh, wow.  And the deer will come within six or seven feet, and they just love it, they can take pictures, and they all got names, and he'll tell them the names, talk to them. And I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I think the deer understand kids better than they do us anyway. We had some bad  one time, I'm the bad guy, I do all the tranquilizer and medicate. But Zachy is the generous one, he goes in there and they follow him around. Wow, that sounds amazing, they can feel the connection. Well I mean, he used to be in Special Olympics, and quite involved in that before my parents got sick, and I was a volunteer and a coach. Absolutely. They used to bring athletes down there and Zach'd take them in the pen, and the deer would follow these athletes all over the pen. Wow, that sounds so interesting. I want a job like that. They seem to know when people aren't a threat, and they knew they weren't a threat, so they'd just hang out with them. Wow. They're smarter than me. They are. They are?  It's fun to watch, it really is. It is really fun to watch, I can imagine that.  I call Zack my little Dr. Doolittle. That's funny. Any other jobs that Zach is currently doing, other than the deer business, the volunteering job, and the main job that he's doing, any other activities he's doing? Not really, well, he and I like to go to car shows and swap meets in summer when they have them. Cool. Last year they were all shut down because of the pandemic- Oh, yeah. ... but they're opening back up. We're looking forward to one in April. He's got an old truck, he likes old vehicles, so he's always looking for something for his truck. But we have a lot of fun with that, he gets to spend some of his disposable cash on meaningless things. I mean,  done everything I wanted was meaningless too, but what the heck, no, he worked for it. Right. And I sincerely hope that that would happen for you and Zach, I hope everything will be open- Well, one day we'll rebuild our garage. So right now we've got a very big portable garage in the back yard, and I think two thirds is his good junk. I think that's what I did to my dad in his garage. Father and son. So that will be all of the questions I have for us today. Any other comments that you would like to provide? Or anything that we didn't cover today that you would like to tell us about? Oh, I think you people are doing a wonderful job. Oh, thank you so much. For being advocates for people on the spectrum. And when Zach was diagnosed, there wasn't that much going on, it was like pulling teeth to find out what services we could get him, to have as normal a life as possible. Because, they was good to us too, so please just keep doing what you're doing. We want to try to help any way we can for anybody in the future. Absolutely. Thank you so much again for your participation, and your participation is really, really important, so that we can further help more families. So we're also- Well thanks for helping us. ... very grateful that you're contributing your time for this program, we really, really appreciate it. Not a problem, ? Yeah, okay. So before I let you go today, I just wanted to verify whether there are any changes to your current email or mailing address, to make sure that we have the correct information. Okay. So the email I got on file is, S-C-O-T-T-S-C-H-O-O-N-O-V-E-R-193@gmail.com. Is that correct? Correct. All right. Were there any changes to your mailing address? No. Okay, great. All right. And that will conclude our interview today. I'll let you get back to enjoying this Sunday, and I wish you and your family a great rest of the year, okay? You too, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you so much. All right, have a great day. You too. Bye. All right. Bye-bye.\n",
            "finishOkay, sorry about the wait. Okay. Last time you spoke with someone at Assist, you discussed some activities Justin had been involved in, and we would love to hear what he's doing now. And we'll start by talking about his high school experience. And it sounds like he is not in high school anymore, right? No. Okay. Is he still receiving services through the school system or not so much? No. He graduated, he had the option of graduating when he was 22, but we thought he was higher functioning so he actually did go to college for a year and a half. Okay. Got it. Whitewater. Whitewater through the, what was it? Off the disabilities... Disabilities program there at Whitewater. At the college level? College level, yes. Okay. All right. It sounds like you planned for Justin to stay one more year, but then he didn't and ended up graduating sooner. Is that right? For? No. Okay. He was going to high school. He graduated from high school. Okay. After four years of graduation, he did graduate high school in the four years. And do you remember which year that was? Sorry to interrupt. When did he graduate? 2015? 2015. Okay. Was that in like June? May? June. June. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry. Continue. You were saying? Then he had good enough grades to actually get accepted at UW Whitewater and did really well his first year, part of Center for Disabilities. He was part of that program. And then he did get into the conspiracy theories that year. And then that's when, the second year is when everything fell to pieces. The first semester, everything just fell apart. No, the first semester of the second year. The first semester of the second year, everything fell apart. The first year went good. The first year went good. He had like a 3.2 grade point the first year. So his grades were impacted because of the theories that he got into? Yes, he could, he was so obsessed with the, yeah. He had a 3.2 GPA his first year in college, which is not bad for an autistic. That's pretty good. Yeah. And then the second year he just failed out all of his classes because he couldn't stop looking at , he to do medical withdrawal because he couldn't stop looking at conspiracy theory. He was obsessed with them. I'm so sorry to hear that. So were we. Yep. Yeah. I was telling Bill here that I have some personal experience with conspiracy theory, not personal, but close family, and it's very upsetting. I can relate. It's really, it's very toxic. It's a very toxic , it's almost like it becomes a addiction, like a drug or something. It's very toxic. Yep. It really gets people off course. Yes, absolutely. And I was telling Bill before, I feel like they should be responsible for the harm they're doing.  Yeah. Absolutely there needs to be some responsibility in, this all happened, it was kind of almost connected to everything with the election when it went down, . And there was, I think there was some Russian interference and some other stuff that was going on with this at the same time and I think he got sucked into the political part of things too. Right.  Oh yeah. It was 2016-ish. Oh it was. It was complete chaos in the internet at that time so he got just sucked into all that garbage. And he's not able to decipher between reality and fiction so he got completely drawn into it and thought it was real. He thought everything he saw on there was the truth, and it wasn't, but it shaped all of his . We still can't get him to understand what's reality and what's not. Yeah. Man, I'm so sorry to hear that. I'm personally angry about it. All I can say is there was justice in 2020. Absolutely. A little bit of justice. Not all of my, a little bit of satisfaction. Oh, he's still messed up. But he's up there with ... Right. At least they're not in power anymore, right? Yeah. Even the country's in better shape.  Yep. Absolutely. The whole country's in better shape. Yep. Absolutely. That's one positive thing. Yeah. So going back to the high school, it sounds like he got a regular diploma. Is that what I heard? Yes. Okay. All right.  Special Ed. Sorry? He's always received . He's always been, received Special Ed. He's always had an IEP, but we always made, that was our thing. We didn't want him to use autism as an excuse. We wanted him to work harder to do, to excel. Right. Absolutely. And during high school, he just did, he just accepted it and just did it. Where it's like after he grad-- when he got to college, that's when he decided that he was not going to do it anymore. Okay. And thank you so much for your confidence in me to tell me all these stuff. I know it can be tough to discuss these type of stuff, especially it feels like a disruption to Justin's education. Well, if we can help somebody else, I guess, it's worth... Absolutely. It's very valuable information here. For the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask you guys about the employment, anything, daily activities that Justin's been attending since the last time we spoke. What does a typical week look like for Justin? Well, he has , he has had some Autism Society events, like game nights and stuff on Mondays and support groups on Wednesdays once a month. Is it once a month? Once a month. So he does some of that, which is kind of good. And once a month is a game night. Nice. Is that in person? No. That's virtual. Okay.  He did go in person before COVID but now it's all virtual. Okay. And it's pretty good. They got a pretty good thing going there. , that would, sand activity and that kind of thing. But now they're kind of just, that's all on hold until. Well, it's virtual. It's all virtual. Okay. Is he involved in any of the vocational training program or unpaid internship or anything like that? No. Okay. What about sheltered workshop? No.  No, that's, yeah, that's the early one. Okay. Any volunteering activities he's doing? Not right now because, like I said ... Before COVID. Before COVID, that's the whole social bubble thing. Because he would guarantee would get us COVID. I can almost pretty much guarantee it. He would get too close and that would pretty much happen. Or he'd offend somebody. Or he'd get, offend somebody because he'd get too close to them. Yeah, it wouldn't be good. Okay. Is it because he doesn't believe in social distancing or is he not getting the concept of social distancing? He would do it. He'll do it but you have to constant-- he's not,  it's not a, I think it's more like you said. He doesn't understand it. It's not like he doesn't believe in it. It's just that he doesn't understand that he's too close to you. He's not consciously aware. Yeah. He's not consciously aware. Okay. All right. With all the game night and all the activities he's doing, how many hours per week on average would that be? Well, that would only be... Two hours a month for each activity. Two hours a month, each activity. One hour a week maybe. One hour a week? Okay. And then the worker takes them to do Frisbee golf and things like that, activities at the park. Yeah. Worker takes them to the park to do stuff, Frisbee golf and that kind of thing. Okay. Got it. And it sounds like Justin's not, or hasn't been enrolled in academic programs since this last May? Well, that was ... 2020. So it'd be before, between May 2020 and now, is he enrolled in any of the vocational school's academic programs? No. Okay. 2016. 2016 was the last . Okay. Fall semester, 2016. Okay. And what about vocational schools or any type of educational settings? We'd love that, but . No. He refuses any education right now. Okay. And this is because of the conspiracy theories that he believes that school is harmful for him? Yep. It's brain washing. Okay. All right. I remember you briefly mentioned that Justin had a job right before COVID. Could you elaborate more on that? Yeah, he probably would still be there. He worked at ShopCo and ShopCo went out of business. Oh, okay. They were actually,  yeah, he didn't get fired. He worked until the end. They were happy with him, they liked it there, but they went out of business and after that, it's just like people in this town don't want, they're very reluctant to give special needs individuals jobs. Right. We had an excellent job coach and we had an excellent DBR . Yes, we did have an excellent DBR and a job coach back at the time when he got that job. He was phenomenal. And then after that he left and then it got moved to some place, to some  out of the county. Then it was the very difficult after that. Okay. Yeah. In a small town like this, if you don't, if the person doesn't know these businesses, these people in this town, they won't give . Okay. And it sounds, is Shop and Co a family connection? The what? Shop and co, the place, ShopCo? ShopCo. That was the big ShopCo that went out of, they went bankrupt. Okay. And not even because of COVID, just went out of business. They just went out of business, yeah. Okay. Yeah. You know the ShopCo because you're in Madison, right? Yes. ShopCo optical? No, the ShopCo, the whole, the stores, all of the stores in this, Monroe was one of them that went under, like the one that's, all of them went under . They only have the ShopCo Optical. They only have ShopCo Optical. They used to have a ShopCo by Metcalf's over by Westown. That was a ShopCo. That was in, it was a chain, like a Target, that kind of thing. Okay. And that's, so they had one, it was a discount store in Monroe and now they don't. They all went out of business. Oh, okay. Got you. I'm not originally from Wisconsin, so I'm a little unfamiliar with that, but it's good to know that. I'm sorry. Some background story. I'm pretty, you must be pretty new here then if you didn't know there's a ShopCo over there, because it only went out of business probably what? Two years ago? Recently. Yeah. Well, I came here like three years ago and I'm a grad student and I don't really go out. Oh yeah. Or to ShopCo. Sure. All right. That'll be all of the prepared question that we have. Is there anything else you would like to tell us or any updates you want to share that we didn't cover? I can't think of any. Okay. You already gave me a lot of valuable information, so thanks. All right. Before I let you go today, I wanted to verify the email address and mailing address. Are those both still the same? Yes. Okay. Got it. And that'd be all my questions today. And thanks again for taking the time to do this with me. I'm so sorry to hear anything about the conspiracy theories. I personally share that anger with you as well. I certainly hope things will get better and hope that Assist can help you through that process. Yeah. Yes. And hope to... They have given us a lot of information from... Right. From the Assist program so it's helped us to, we have tools at least for the future to at least know where to go, which we didn't know. We knew some of them, but we, there was a lot that was given to us that we can use in the future. Absolutely. That's great to hear. Yeah. I hope that will work out for your family and hope that we'll talk to each other again, if not soon. Okay. All right. Have a good rest of your night. Yep. Good night. Say bye to your wife too. Okay. . Bye.\n",
            "finish... involved. And I don't even have that much control. He likes having old . Okay. I'm sorry to change my answer. Yeah. That's okay. It's like once you start talking about it, sometimes you were like, well, actually this is actually a detail to add. Yeah. . Yeah. How is the service provider or agency involved in making decisions about whether to resume services? Very involved. I kind of depend on them to do everything. All right. So that was the second section. We're moving on the third one right now. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything here. All right. Right, so last time we spoke, we discussed some activities William has been involved in. We would love to hear what he is doing now. Is William in high school? In what now? High school? Yes. Is William currently working? No. And why is William not currently working? You know, I think what  the last word you say trails off. Could you repeat the last one? Yeah, sorry. Why is William not currently working? Because his  manager says that happens... Okay. Okay. Has William worked and left any jobs since March 25th, 2021, the date that we last spoke with you? No. Has William volunteered in the community during high school since the last time we spoke? No.\n",
            "finish. ... and high school. So the last time that you spoke with us, we discussed some activities Samuel had been involved in. So we'd like to hear what he's up to right now. So we'll start by talking about high school experience. It sounds like he is not in high school anymore. Is that right? Correct. Okay. Is he attending any transitional program through the school? Any vocational skills, or even staying connected to the school? Nope. Once they graduate you, they're done. Okay. He is done. Okay. And then did his high school track or plans change? So it sounds like he graduated, and that was the plan the whole time. Mm-hmm . Okay. So what year and month did he exit high school? January 2020. January 2020? Mm-hmm . And then what kind of diploma did he see? So regular diploma, certification of completion. It was a regular diploma. Great. All right. So we're going to look at post high school activities. So what does typical week look like for Samuel? How has he been spending his time? He works probably, I would say, an average of 24 hours a week. And then he spends some time intermittently doing online stuff with friends, like every other week. So not a ton. Okay. He goes to church online. Okay. And he goes to a small group. He's done several small groups for church that have all been virtual. Virtually. Okay. Okay. So you said he works on average about 24 hours a week, and that's at the grocery store? Correct. Okay. So I'm going to have a list of things that it'll ask me if Samuel is currently involved in. I'll just go through them, and just let me know if he is. So post-secondary education? So that would be like community college, trade school, anything like that. Right. No. Okay. Vocational training program or unpaid internship? No. Adult day care program? You already said no for that. Right. Sheltered workshops? Doesn't sound like that applies. No. Working for pay with support? So does he get any supports at the grocery store? No. Okay. So he is working for pay independently. Right. Is he volunteering in the community? Not since COVID. Yeah, that's hard. Okay. So how many total hours during the week does Samuel participate in vocational educational activities? It sounds like the 24 that he is going to work are his main- Yeah. Okay. Great. Okay. So This next part is a school program attended after high school, so might not apply, but Samuel is not currently enrolled in any academic program. So just to clarify, he was enrolled in a community college class prior to graduation of high school? Is that right? Yeah. So the dual enrollment class. Yeah. Oh, okay. It's like... Okay. Dual, yeah. And then that ended when school ended? Yeah. I mean, it was a fall course, so it was September through December. Okay. And then he was. September through December. Great. All right. Okay. So the next part, vocational activity. So he is currently employed. I'm going to put working for pay independently. What is the name of the grocery store that he works at? He works for a Pick 'n Save. Pick 'n Save. And then can you tell me a little bit about what he does at Pick 'n Save? Yeah, he's a front end worker, currently. So primarily, he bags groceries, pulls in carts. I think he pulls garbages, stuff like that. Okay. It sounds like he does not receive any supports. No. And he never... He didn't start with any supports or anything like that? Okay. No. And then he's paid for the activity? Yeah. How did Samuel find the job? He actually started in another grocery store. Oh. I mean, I think that it helped that his brother had worked there. Oh, sure. Okay. And I mean, really, it was kind of based on that, that she was, that they were willing to give it a shot, because his interview was probably not typical. Okay. Okay. So 24 hours a week. Do you remember exactly when Samuel started at Pick 'n Save? It would've been October 2019. 2019? Okay. And then do you think this a good fit for Samuel? This job is a good fit for Samuel's skills and interests? No. Okay. Why? Because he finds the customer interaction piece of it extremely stressful. Okay.  Do you have any additional comments about out this job? Any circumstances that you want to explain? Anything else? Well, yeah, I think it's probably fair to... At the point where they were moving him around in departments, he had a day where he got yelled at, he perceived as being reprimanded heavily by a supervisor, and he left. Oh, okay. So that was a problem. Okay. And that's one of the reasons why I think that it would be helpful for him, well, first of all, to find something that fit him a little bit better, and second of all, to have some support in finding that kind of a thing. And the other thing is that, I mean, the pay is not livable. Yeah. You can't live on 9.75 an hour. Yeah. Okay. So has he participated in any other employment, vocation, volunteering since February of last year that we haven't talked about? No. Okay. All right. So anything else you want to tell us about, anything that we've talked about tonight? Anything else? Wow. That was . Not that I can think of, no. And then lastly, we just want to verify the current email address is the purple chef one that I contacted you on, still your primary email address? Yeah, that's great. Okay. Wonderful. Okay. We are all through. We zoomed through it. So I wanted to say thank you so much, because this wouldn't obviously be possible without your guys' participation, and we know things are kind of crazy right now. So taking the time out to do this, we're really grateful for it. Yeah. You're welcome. Okay, Andrea. Thank you so much. Have a great rest of your day. Yeah. Thank you. You too. Okay. Bye-bye. All right. Bye-bye.\n",
            "finishLast question about work. Has she done any volunteering in the community during high school? No. Okay. All right, so that was that one. That was quick. All right. Great. So, we're going to talk about services next. Just give me one second.\n",
            "finishPlease describe Tyler's high school situation. That's a pretty open-ended question. What exactly are you looking for here? I'll move on to the next one, which should give you a better idea about this. Did Tyler's high school tracker plans change since we last spoke? No. Okay. When did Tyler exit high school? Well, when he was 21. Do you want the year? Yeah, if you have the month and year, that would be helpful. That would've been June. Let's see, it's 2021. He'll be 26, so that would've been five years ago. That would've been June, 2016. Okay. What type of diploma did Tyler receive? This could be regular diploma, occupational diploma, certificate of completion, or other. I'm not really sure, honestly. That might sound really bad. I'm not sure. As far as I know, it was a regular diploma, but he was in a lot of special classes, so it could have just been a certificate of completion. Okay. Okay. For the rest of this interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that Tyler attended since February 3rd, 2020. Okay. Okay. First, I like to get an idea of how Tyler usually spends his time. Let's talk about the activities he participates in during a typical week. What does a typical week look like for Tyler? How has he been spending his time? He works Monday through Friday from about 8:00 to 3:00. Typically, then he would come home and maybe go for a run or a walk. He spends a fair amount of time on Facebook or watching sports online. He does make dinner for himself, takes a shower, makes his lunch for the next day. That would be a typical weekday. Okay. Is that enough information? Yeah, that's great. Thank you. Okay. Then I'll list a few activities here. Let me know if he participates in any of these. In any educational program? No. Vocational training program or unpaid internship? No. Adult day program? No. Sheltered workshop? No. Working for pay with support? Yes. Okay. Working for pay independently? No. Volunteering in the community? No. Okay. Anything else that was not listening? He has done some things for Special Olympics where I believe one time he did give a talk on just what it's like to be a person with a disability. Okay. He also participates... Special Olympics has a weekly online forum, I guess you could call it, for some people from Special Olympics that are employees are on it, but then also a lot of athletes. A lot of the topics are on sports and Tyler will participate in that. He might come prepared to... One time, there was athletes from the Badgers and Tyler had some questions that he interviewed the Badgers on about sports. Okay. Then, about how many total hours during the average week does Tyler spend participating in all of the vocational and educational activities? Like work? Yes. Okay. That's about 35 hours a week. Okay. Next, we'll talk about school programs that Tyler attended after high school, and please discuss any educational activities since February 3rd, 2020. I think I understand that Tyler has not participated in any educational activities since that time. Is that correct? Correct. Yes. Okay. Now, vocational activities. Can you tell me about the jobs or programs beginning with the current or most recent and working back to the last time we spoke in February of 2020. You let me know that he is currently participating in employment. Right. He works for basically the fulfillment department of Woodman, so he will fill the online orders that come in. He will shop the orders and then help to, I guess, stage them where they're kept for when the customers come to pick them up. Okay. What was the name of the department again? It's the online ordering department. Okay. He's technically employed through GrocerKey who Woodmans utilizes to fulfill their online orders. Okay. Then, you did say Tyler receives the support while employed and mentioned the job coach. Is there anything else? I don't think so. Okay. You mentioned before this is a paid activity, correct? Correct. Okay. How did Tyler find this job? It was through Advanced Employment, the  rehab company that works with Tyler. He had a couple of other jobs, and when he had a few things that it didn't work out, they suggested this position, and he has been there for several years now. Okay. How many hours per week on average does Tyler participate in this activity? This is about 35 hours a week. Okay. What month and year did Tyler start this job? Oh, boy. I'm really not sure. I'm going to have to just throw out a guess. Sure. I would say maybe March of 2018. Okay. Do you think this job is a good fit for Tyler's skills and interests? Why or why not? I think it is. I think he likes it. I know that they really like having him. They think he's a good employee. Tyler gets to move around. He gets to be somewhat social and talk to other people. They've given him more responsibility with this job. He didn't get to fill online orders when he first started, he just would pack up orders that other shoppers had shopped, so I think that that's a good fit for him. Okay. I'm not sure if this is his ideal dream job forever and ever. The other thing that's really nice about this job is the location. It's about a half a mile from where he lives, so he can walk to and from. Okay. Okay. We have about one minute left and there are a couple questions left. If you would like to end at 1:00 and continue this at another time, we can do that. Otherwise, I am available for the next 15 minutes. Why don't we just go ahead and finish it up? Okay. Do you have any additional comments about this job, or if there are any other circumstances you would like to explain, please feel free to elaborate? I think that's it for his job. Okay. Has Tyler participated in any other employment, vocational, or volunteering activities since February 3rd, 2020? No. Okay. Is there anything else you would like to tell us or share in terms of updates? I don't think so. There really haven't been a whole lot of updates in the past year. Okay. Then, that brings us to our last question, which is to verify mailing address and email address. Have there been any changes? No. Okay. Great. Actually, we . We actually finished in the last minute. Well, there we go. Thanks so much for taking the time to talk with us today. Assist would not be possible without your participation. . Well, you're very welcome. Thank you. All right. Have a wonderful day. Thanks. You, too. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.\n",
            "finishSo, okay. So with doing another semester means like you guys probably plan for him to graduate in like December? Like what month- I think if that's doable. I'm not even sure. I haven't talked to his case manager at school yet about it, just because I think I'm hoping that we can pull him through and get him to graduate. And I think we probably will. And I don't even want to really open the door yet to the possibility that we might not make that goal, because I don't want to give an excuse that, \"Oh, I can do another semester.\" I want him to be on track. Okay. So remind me, is Joshua currently working right now? He is, right? He's starting a new job. We're starting to work with a job agency through DVR again. Okay. But the job is not starting yet. Right. Yeah. We've got to figure out where he wants to work and apply and do- Okay. ... all of the steps. So this question would be, has Joshua worked and left any job since last time we talked? And that would be a yes, because you did a eight-week. Yeah. Okay. So would that be the only job that he worked during high school for the- Yeah. ... past couple months? Okay. Right. He tried to do a volunteer position, I think the summer before last, but we didn't disclose his disability early and he didn't want a job coach. And then it kind of, it didn't turn out well. And I was really disappointed. He was very disappointed. It's really hard to hear. Yeah. Yeah. Disappointing kids. Yeah. And it was a really fun volunteer opportunity too. Yeah. So for this job that he did, did he receive payments? He did receive payments. DVR paid the employee. I guess when they work with DVR, DVR pays the wages for the employer. So it encourages the employer to take on people with disabilities. Okay, cool. So where was this job at? Do you remember? It was at Festival, grocery store. Oh, I left them there. Is that the one in your community? Yeah. I'm assuming there's no grocery stores in school. Okay. Right. Okay. Yeah, because that'll be the next question. I'm pretty sure there's no Festival in the school. It'd be awesome, but there's no - Yeah. Many kids will like that, go buy their own food. Yeah. It'd be great. And this was the job that was found via DVR, correct? Yeah. Okay. So how many hours a week would you say on average did Joshua work at this job? Boy, I don't remember. Was it like eight hours a week? I think. Okay. And what month and year did Joshua begin working at this job? Oh gosh, 2020. And it was probably July and August. Okay. Might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure. What is time these days? Yeah. It all rolls together. So would you say like the end of August? Like the whole month of August or the beginning of August? Yeah. No, the whole month of August because I think it stopped like right before you went back to school. Okay. All right. So for this shop, can you tell me a little bit more about the duties that Joshua was doing? He was stocking in the grocery and freezer or the... No, I'm sorry. Not the grocery. It's a grocery store. He was stacking in the dairy in the freezer section. Okay. Gotcha. Did Joshua receive support during this job when he was working? Yeah. He initially had a job coach and then they... I think towards the rest, like the first couple of weeks. And then they would check in on him every now and then to see how he was doing. And you mentioned that the reason for Joshua to leave that job was because the job changed because of COVID? Wait. Sorry. No, it wasn't. Yeah, that's okay. It was an eight-week contract. Because what we complained about that we... I wanted him to get experience in different jobs in different settings in the community. And so we kind of figured we'd do like eight weeks at Festival and then go to somewhere else for eight weeks and then somewhere else for eight weeks and then round back around to see what he really liked. And I think we're going to... I would like him to do that again because I don't want... I want him to kind of get a diverse experience to see what he really likes and what he doesn't like. Okay. Do you think that this vessel job was a good fit for Josh's skills and interests? I think it was okay. What area of it was like a good fit and what area does not seem to fit? I didn't get a whole lot of feedback and he doesn't volunteer a lot of feedback, I should say too. So I just, I think there's just skills that he needs to work on and kind of being aware and being mindful of what he's doing and how he's doing it. But I think socially, it seemed really good for him. And he seemed happy and he seemed pretty confident with it. So that's not the best of feedback, but it's hard to kind of give real specific feedback because it was pulling teeth to get anything. Yeah. I mean, not complaining about the job. I just mean it works pretty well, right? Right. Yeah, exactly. He wasn't coming home grumpy, so that's a good thing. Right. Yeah. It's a good sign. So other than that volunteer position that unfortunately fell through, did Josh volunteer in the community during high school? At any other places? No. Okay. No. Okay. Is there anything else you would like to tell us or any updates you wanted to share that we didn't really cover? I think you covered things pretty thoroughly. I can't really think of anything. I think the whole friend piece is something that he struggles with. Oh, good. That he's ever struggled with. And part of-  something. Right. And I feel like part of that again is hard on me being a single parent. Not to make excuses, but to be a single parent and then working full time with a two hour commute, really cuts into like my availability to nurture and foster a lot of those relationships. So that's an area I feel is a big hole that I couldn't really avoid, but I continually feel bad about because that social piece is so important. And I feel like that's an area where the school did as much as they could, but it would've been nice to be able to have more. I don't even know what, or how I could have helped them with that more. Absolutely. It sounds like you've done a lot for him already and - Trying. Yeah. The social piece, it's also like really subtle and hard to gauge how you can help to help build relationship, but not like overstep. Right. It's a hard thing to support. Exactly. Absolutely. Okay. Yeah. So I think that would be all the questions for today. And thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me today. And I mean, this project will be impossible without people/folk's participation, so I really appreciate it. Also, before we leave, I also wanted to verify your email and mailing address. So is the email address that I emailed you, the link is still works for you? Yeah. Okay. And are there any changes to the mailing address? Nope, it's the same. Okay. All right. Great. Thank you so much. And I think that will be all the questions,- Okay. ... many, many questions that I had today. So I'm going to have one of my colleagues to send out some more forms and follow-ups details with you. Okay. And if you don't have any other questions-\n",
            "finish... so no you're youth like . Oh Kaylen. How is Kaylen involved in making those decisions? Yeah. She's always included in those decisions. How is the service provider involved in making those decisions?  Do you have any overall comments about COVID and the service? No. So now we go to the next section. So last time we spoke, we discussed some activity Kaylen has been involved in. We would like to hear how she's doing now. So Kaylen is still in high school at this time? Yes. And she plan to graduate in May 2022. Correct? Yes. So is Kaylen currently working? No. I apologize. That's okay. Okay. I'm back. Sorry. And do you mind telling me why Kaylen is not currently working? She looked all summer for a job and had interviews, but nobody would schedule her and bring her around. We paused the search now that she's in school to give her some time. So do you mind telling me, has Kaylen worked and left any job since May 4th, 2021? No. Has Kaylen volunteered in the community during high school since last time we talked? Yes. Where does Kaylen volunteer? She'd be better to answer. She went to a nursing home once. And then- In a nursing home. Is that correct? A nursing home, yeah. Okay. To help with bingo. And then she did some through the school district area schools they needed some volunteers to help run events. So she helped out at several events. Okay. So we go to the last session. So during the first visit we set three new goals with you.\n",
            "finishIt could be a job with a school program. It could be something out. Does it have to be paid employment? No. Oh then yes. Okay. So can you tell me a little bit about what kinds of jobs has she done and was it through school? Yeah. So in high school there were goals that were definitely towards vocational. So if you consider these to be jobs, she was responsible for distributing the newspaper at various classrooms to various teachers. She was involved in recycling. Okay. She was involved a little bit in the coffee cart program. Those were kind of in high school, in transition, which has only been because of COVID, from September, because she just started transition this past school year. So from September to March, she was interning at a resale store. So lots of hanging and sorting clothes, packaging these resale bags that were full of different things, labeling items, those were the primary things. Privately, I connected with a woman who owns a real insurance agency. So she let us come in and help to volunteer for different tasks there, sorting paper and putting them in the appropriate binders, shredding, putting stamp on mailers. So, okay. Hold on. I'm sorry. Did you want me to get... No. It's okay. It's about me finding the right place to put it in our program here. It's not about you going too fast. Did she? So this was volunteer work in... What was the name of the insurance company? Well it's Sarah Crawford, American Family Insurance. Perfect. Okay. Shredding, putting things in binders. Did you say something else I missed? Camping for mailers and cleaning. Great. Going back to the job at the recycling or sorry, it's a resale store, right? I'm going to focus I think on that one. Did she get paid for that one? No. It's through... Or the transition? It's through the program at the transition. And what is the name of the store? Bethesda. It was one of the community partners for the transition program at our district. Perfect. Okay. Is it just like Bethesda clothing or resale? You can call Bethesda resale. Okay. And about how many hours a week was she before COVID working there? Eight. Oh really? Okay. Alright. And did she start like in August of this year? September? September. September. Great. Well in 2019, yeah. Okay. And did she get support while working at the resale? Yes, she had. Okay. Great. And do you think that the job is a good fit for both skills and interests? Yes. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about why? Well, as I mentioned to Janice, she's very task oriented. Brooke is great as long as she feels competent in a task. I mean, I think that's normal for all human beings, but particularly for someone who challenges with language. Yes. Okay. So if she could rely visually in the environment and knows what's expected. I know what's on a desk. I know what's on the table. I know how many, because it's already been put in front of me. I know all the steps. Initially, if you might have to guide her through some of the steps, but as long as there's a pattern. She's also very pattern oriented and that's different from... What's the word? Some kids have to do things in a certain way. Yes. But it doesn't necessarily have to do things in a certain way, but she knows what the end result is. So as long as the pattern is somewhat the same for the end result, she's very task oriented. So doing things in that kind of environment where it's a little bit repetitive, but it's not really about the repetition, it's about feeling competent. So set her up for success. She felt competent there. She learned the routines and kind of got them down? Yep. Okay. She has motor coordination challenges. So there were times when we would have to modify and the instructor, a BCBA, you know what a behavior analyst is? Or the teacher would get creative about, well, let's get this set up this way so that Brooke doesn't have to go do this piece, which is a motor challenge for her. Let's just take that out of the equation. And, but she still had to work through a lot of steps. Does that make sense? That makes total sense. Absolutely. So the nature of the job, and then also with the support in place and the different people helping make it a place where she could be successful also taking into consideration some of her physical challenges. Yep. Okay, great. Has she volunteered anywhere else besides the insurance place? Just one time. And I don't even know, it was one time where our chamber needed something for a fest that was going on in my community and so we went to the chamber office and helped fold all of and count all of the volunteer shirts. So she did that one time. Okay, great. Oh, I take that back. So she still does ABA. Okay. So my ABA agency two summers ago also got her to do some volunteer work at a different resale store, but very similar to what she was doing at the internship at our transition program, sorting things, hanging clothes. Okay, great.\n",
            "finishThe activities Cyrus has been involved in, just because we'd love to hear about what he's currently doing right now. Okay. I know that Cyrus is no longer in high school. Okay. One moment. I'm just making a note about when he exited high school. Okay. For the next section, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that Cyrus attended since April 15, 2021 of this year. First, I'd like to get an of how Cyrus usually spends his time. We'll talk about the activities that he participates in during a typical week. What does a typical week look like for Cyrus, and how is he spending his time? He is not engaged in any activities other than with the family. I take him on a hike every day to a city park, city, county, or state park, or the ice age trail. On weekends, we'll be gone longer, maybe four hours. Weekdays, it'll be an hour, an hour and a half. His sister visits. We'll have ... Well, we had been having dinner with her out on the driveway. Yeah. She was part of our hiking until she moved away in late August. Okay. Otherwise, we have dozens of jigsaw puzzles. We have him Lego sets. Sometimes Randy takes him on walks too, or a drive. Cy and I bake together. We joke around together, but these are ... He doesn't have a lot of structure to his day, other than his outings with me. I take him on errands to places that will deliver things to the car, stores that will just put the thing on top of the car. Okay. He uses his iPad for listening to music, playing games, watching videos, using Google maps. Okay. How many total hours during the average week does Cyrus spend participating in all those activities, would you say? Just a rough average. Cook. Some cooking. Okay. We keep the cookies in my room, and he just hid them, but I think my husband knows what he's doing. Okay. Just a second. No worries at all. Okay. Thanks. I hope the mute worked and that I wasn't screaming in your ear. Yeah, yeah. Okay. No, no, no. All right. Okay. Number of hours for those things a week? Yeah, just on average. Going to say ... This is over seven days? Yeah, just during an average week. Yeah. Maybe 30 hours. Okay. Now, we'll talk about ... Shift gears here and talk about school programs that Cyrus attended after high school, if any. Is Cyrus currently enrolled, or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college, college, or university? No. No. Okay. Okay. I just want to clarify, there's been no involvement in any academic program since graduation of high school? Right. Okay. Just wanted to clarify that. Okay. I should ... He took a Microsoft office course through an agency. I don't know if that's considered academic or not. I'll make a note of it. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. The next question is Cyrus currently participating in any employment, vocational, or volunteering activities? He is ... I don't know how to answer this. He's still getting paid for his job, but he's not working. Okay. He's not ... However that ... I don't know how that counts. Okay. Was this through, just to clarify, was this through the employment that was supported by advanced employment? They gave a job coach to support him going to the job, but they didn't pay, but the job was at a different entity. A job was at Dreamweavers, a nonprofit. Cy is still getting paid by Dreamweavers, even though he's not working, because they're hoping he'll come back. Okay. Did he pause employment sometime between the last interview on April 15th of this year? Or was that prior that the employment was paused? He paused in March of 2020. Okay. But they have been paying him since. Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. Okay. The nonprofit was called Dream weavers? Uh huh , all one word. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Okay. The last portion of the interview is related to the goals, and following up about the 12 month ... Or, all months since the goals were first set with Project Assist. During the first visit, we had set three annual goals with you and with Cyrus. The purpose of this goal development was to support families in helping the young adult pursue their dreams for the future and really start working on these goals. Since about a year has passed now, we want to know how they're doing with these goals, but before we can continue to discuss this progress, we just wanted to remind the families that we know a lot has happened over this past year and before, due to the pandemic. There's just a lot of unpredictability. We just wanted to recognize that. We understand if COVID might have imposed barriers to completing certain goals. The first goal was given guidance and support, the youth will identify and describe three jobs that match his skills and interests.\n",
            "finishPull up the next part, so it's going to take my computer a second to think. Okay. Okay. So last time we spoke, we discussed some activities that McKenna had been involved in and we'd like to hear what she's doing now. We do start everyone with high school questions. So just to double check, I know last time you said McKenna was out of high school, but is she still receiving any services to the school system? None. Did anything about her high school track or plans change since last time we spoke? No. Do you remember when McKenna left high school? The year and month? Okay. Hang on one second. Sure. Okay. Go ahead. So for the last question. Yeah. Do you remember the year and month that McKenna left high school? Gosh, so let's see. She was 21. So she is turning 24. So it would've been, let's see, three years ago. It would've been May of- May of 2018? Yeah. May of 2018. May or June 2018. Great. What type of diploma did McKenna receive? What kind of what? Diploma? Oh, I guess she got a regular diploma. Yeah. Yes. High school diploma. So now I'm going to ask some questions about academic programs, employment or volunteering, that McKenna may have done since January of 2020, the last time we spoke. Okay. So first I'd just like to get an idea of how she spends her time. So what does a typical look, sorry... A typical week look like for McKenna. How is she spending her time? A typical week for McKenna? Well, let's see. She starts her day with checking sports news. She checks to see when all of her favorite teams are playing and if she checks scores, she checks to see if there's any team changes. She also, obviously there's meal times in there. There's personal hygiene times in there; showers, brushing teeth, meds, all that stuff. She watches some TV, but a lot of time is spent on the internet. She spends a lot of time on her iPad on the internet, either listening to music, checking on her favorite things. What's new in the world of Disney? Or like I said, all her favorite sports teams. So, she does once in a while, go to the grocery store. Now that it's nice out, sometimes she'll sit outside for a while. So that's kind of pretty much her week. Right. How many total hours would you say, during an average week, McKenna spends participating in any sort of vocational or educational activities? Vocational, none. Educational, she kind of does that on her own, on her iPad, where she'll look up something. But as far as formal, none. Okay. Then has McKenna attended any sort of, sorry. Improv-ing. I should read it exactly. Is McKenna currently enrolled, or has she been enrolled, in any academic program at a vocational school, community college, college or university since January of 2020? No. Okay. Has McKenna had any vocational activities since January of 2020, either? No. Okay. So nothing. She worked during that time, but has since left? No. Okay. Great. Anything else you would like to tell us or any other updates you want to share? Mm, I don't think so. Okay. The last thing I have to do is just verify, I have your current contact information. I know we've been emailing. Is that email still the best email address to contact you at? Yes. Has your mailing address changed at all? No. Okay. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today. This would not be possible without your participation and that wraps up the interview. Okay. Sounds good. I'll look for another email from you with whenever we need to meet again or whatever. Yeah. Sarah Bubash, who's sort of my supervisor on the project, should be emailing you soon with a bit of follow-up from this interview and that it'll have, I think kind of what to look for next in it. Okay. Sounds good. Great. Thanks so much for sitting down with me today. Yeah. Have a good day. Yeah. Bye. Bye, bye.\n",
            "finish... and it's very frustrating, but I'm still glad that we have what we have. Yep. Thank you. So now, we go on  exit the school system since May 17, 2021? Yeah, well, she's a student at large at Illinois State University, which means she can take any undergraduate co-level class that's not directed for a major and that's open. And so we've just kind of made our own college experience for Kira, that she attends a regular university class, and my husband goes with her. We didn't ask anybody if he could do that, but he does, and nobody's ever stopped him. Okay. That's good. So now she is the student at ISU? Yes, and this is her fourth year. You know, I guess, I don't know if it's possible to go back, but there was an impact to... Kira's classes went virtual during the pandemic, and then in January of '21, the class that they signed up for, they couldn't find a Zoom link, and this was before vaccines really were available. And when they contacted the professor, the professor said, \"No, we're going to try a social experiment and have it in person.\" Wow. And Paul was like, \"Oh no, we're not.\" And so she took what she called a gap year. She didn't go. She didn't take a class that semester, but you know, she keeps up on social media and Facebook, and so she knew the whole world was taking a gap year, or all kinds of kids her age were taking a gap year. Yeah. So she was okay with that, with that unexpected change. But she has decided that she's exiting college, that's her term for it, in Spring of '22, because it's her belief that people go to college for four years, and she'll have been in college for four years. So she's done. Okay. So she decided she will exit the college in Spring '22? Yes. What we've been referring to as a college experience for her. Right. And she knows that. She knows she's not graduating. She knows that she's having a college experience. Okay. So do you mind telling me, what does a typical week look like for Kira? Right now? Yeah. How is she spending her time now? Well, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, she has her ISU class. History, American history to 1855, on Monday, Wednesday, Fridays from 10:00 to 10:50. And then, on Mondays, she has bowling through Special Olympics, in which she's going to state competition for. Wow. And then Monday night, she has a class called Cardio Fitness that she attends, and then different days, she has different activities, depending on what's available through Bloomington Parks & Rec. So on Wednesday evenings for two hours, she goes to Holiday Performers. On another day, she does a class called Seat To SOAR, I think that might be Tuesdays, which is a running program. On one Friday a month, she does an activity called Friday Night Out with differently-abled peers. It's from 7:00 to... maybe it's 6:00. 6:00 to 9:00 on those nights. And then once a month, she goes to something called ZOOper Fridays at Miller Park Zoo, where they interact with the animals and zoo staff. I mean, so all that kind of stuff. Her week is ISU classes, and then we hire a current college student on Fridays to do some respite for my husband and they, from 1:00 to 4:00 on Fridays, she and Ella just go do whatever college age kids do. Oh, okay. They hang out and go get Starbucks and that kind of stuff. So that's what a typical week looks like for Kira. Oh, she has a pretty packed schedule. Yeah. Yeah. My husband would absolutely agree with you. Okay. Okay. So how many total hours, during the average week, has Kira spent participating in all of this vocational and educational activity? Let's see. One, two, three, four... I'm looking at our big calendar. Yeah. Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. I'd say 12 to 15 hours, and then we have season tickets to ISU football games. So whenever those home games are, we go to those, on Saturdays. Okay. So now, is Kira currently enrolled or has she been enrolled, in an academic program at a vocational school, community college or university? University. Just, like I said, with the one course each semester. Yep. Yeah, ISU. Mm-hmm . Do you mind telling me a little bit about this program? It's just regular college class. It's what anybody who is a student at ISU will take. Okay. So is this an autism or disability-specific program? No. She's just in with the general population of ISU students. But she does get some accommodations, though, through, I don't know what the proper term is, but the Office Of Accommodations And Disability Concerns, or... I don't think it's called that, but it's something like that. Oh, yes. So she just, she takes her exams in a separate setting in that building... Sorry. And has extra time. Those are her accommodations, current accommodations. Extra accommodation... but she's not pursuing... he's not... I'm sorry. So she is not currently seeking a degree, right? No, she is not seeking a degree. She was admitted as a non-degree-seeking student. Right. Do you mind telling me what is Kira's area of study? Whatever's available that my husband thinks he can support with. So it's mostly... her favorite classes are in geography and anthropology, but they stay in the college, pretty much, of Social Sciences. Do you mind telling me again, what is the average number of classes Kira is taking per semester? One class per semester. So is she considered a full-time or part-time student? Part-time. Do you remember the month and year Kira started this program? Yeah. Well, it's not really a program, but so... Paul, what year did Kira start ISU? Kira, what year did you start ISU? I think it was 2018. '17. 2017? Fall of '17. Fall of 2017. Fall... No, it was Fall of 2018. 2018. 2018, right? Because that's when her sister was a freshman in college and that's when she was too. '18. Okay. Yeah. So do you feel this program is a good fit for her? It's an okay fit. I mean, we made it up. Okay. I don't think anybody at ISU knows we're doing this. It's a back door into the university. She didn't have to have a ACT or SAT score to get in. She just had to have her high school transcripts and apply and pay $50 as a non-degree-seeking student. Okay. So do you have any additional comment about her academic program? Yeah, you know, it would be really nice if there was a space for kids like Kira, who academically can cut it, but would need more support in a university setting. And so the reason that we had to take this path is she was rejected twice from the Heartland Community College, from their program, that requires an IEP to enter, because after reading her IEPs, they determined that behavior was going to be a concern for them. And so she was rejected twice. She was rejected in 2016, in 2000... I'm sorry. In 2017 and 2018, which is why we sought out... You know, my husband just called ISU and said, \"What does average Joe Citizen need to do to take a class at ISU?\" And they told him, and that's what she did. Okay. Is Kira currently enrolled in the school program? I'm sorry. Is she enrolled in what? Is she currently enrolled in another school program? No. No. Okay. Is Kira currently participate in any employment, with-\n",

Yeah, I'm going to put that in here too. They should be, We are very proud of you Kira. And I hope you're proud of yourself too. Yeah. Okay. Couple questions about the work that you're doing at Mark First, learning about job skills. Do you think that this program is a good fit for you? Here, you got to speak up so that Molly can do... Yes. Yeah? Okay. And I'm going to ask the same question I did before. Can you tell me why is it a good fit? Why is going to Mark First every week a good fit for you? Cause I like it. Because, I get a job I need. Instead of graduating from college, I get paid certificate instead of a college diploma. Okay. You said you like the program at Mark First? Can you give me one or two things you like about it? Well,  And... What do you like about Mark First? I liked it, because, I give the thumbs up, I write papers. What do you like doing at Mark First?

            "finishDo you want to know where? Or is this just yes or no? No, I will ask you, just one sec. First about how many jobs did she have? Three. Library. Walgreens- School. ... And school. Yeah. Three. Okay. And hold on, I'm going to . Had she ever had a job that was part of high school programming? Yes. Not high school, but when she was in the transition program. Okay. All right. Great, and did she receive payment at any of those jobs during high school? Not payment. She received a Walmart gift card if she met her goals. Once a month, she'd get a $25 gift card from Walmart. You were pretty proud of those. Yeah. . Yep. Of those three, where did she work the longest? That's the one I'm going to ask you questions about. Walgreens. Walgreens. Okay. How did Kira, find the job? Well, it wasn't something that they originally had in mind for her, and it was a combination of the team deciding. I thought she could do more than what she was doing at the public library and doing at the school itself, and so I asked them specifically to do some outside of the box thinking and think about where people were being employed that had special needs. Her transition program poured reached out to Walgreens and then subsequently she had other classmates that ended up working there as well. Great.  Yeah, but initiated by the school system. Okay. All right. About how many hours on average did she work at this job? Three hours a day. Three days a week. About 10, nine or 10 hours a week. Nine or 10 hours a week. Okay. What's that, Kira? She's just being silly. I want to make sure I didn't ignore her. What month and year did she begin working at the job? If you can remember sort of general. December of- Of 16. ... Of 16. December of 16. Yeah. Then she did it for two years. Maybe December of 18, she stopped something like that. Actually in May. May of 18. About two and a half. Can you tell me a little bit about the job, what she did at the job? She did the facing of the products and check for out dates and answered, if customers did come in and ask where something was, with a little bit of support, she always had an aid, she would answer those questions. Limited interaction with the public, basically, pulling old stock and getting new stock on the shelves facing properly. When is it? 2022. Okay. . Do you want to do that? Yeah. Okay. Did she have a one-on-one aid the whole time with her? She did. What we worked towards the last semester, for sure, maybe even before that they pulled back on those supports so that the person was always there with her, but was no longer in the aisle with her so that she was there in case of emergency or meltdown or something like that, but really did a nice job of having it be Kira's and being there as just in case. Great. Do you all think this job is a good fit for her? It was because she really felt like part of the staff, then the pharmacy staff, all of them, everybody at Walgreens was really great, they loved Kira. The public liked interacting with her. I think that that was one of the things that we were so pleasantly surprised with is a lot of the jobs before that didn't have interactions with people, and Kira, is very much interested in interactions with people. She's a tasker, she wants to finish whatever task she starts, and once she knows how to do something, she can do it independently. She also does very much like to have interactions with people. Okay. Walgreens was a really good fit for that. Well, that type of task, she really excels in and she can read the fine print. She knows what she's looking for. It's very structured, so she really liked it. Great. Okay. It was both, working with the people, and then also the nature of the other part of the job, sort of the ordering of the foods and the- Yeah. ... Checking labels. Is that what you mean by out date? Even with medicines, she does it now, even when we go to the stores, she checks for out dates and I get in trouble because I always take the stuff from the very back. I want the furthest out date and she was the one responsible for the putting stuff in front, so she knows I'm supposed to take the stuff in front. Yeah. She pulls you out on it. Yeah. Did she volunteer at all during high school? Well, yeah, she did the Tootsie Roll Drive. Some of these things weren't through the school system, but she's also been involved in a lot of community type pieces, so if we would bring bells for Salvation Army, she would help with that. Then there were organized activities around Kira, and her peers. Like special Olympics related or- Right. Raising money, fundraising the programs that she's in- For Best Buddies, that type of thing. Yeah. When she was in Best Buddies in high school, and then she's still involved with Best Buddies with Illinois State University. If they do an kind of fundraiser, she does those activities. Okay. But that kind of volunteering. Okay. All right. Now we've captured high school. I'm going to ask you for the rest of this assessment to talk about how she spends her time now. I think it's best to maybe talk about before COVID because as we know, everything is . If you could describe, I'm thinking about jobs, post-secondary programs, you mentioned college class with Paul. Could you tell me a little bit about how does she spend a typical week? A typical week, she would have class two or three times a week for an hour or so, so there's the prep of getting and going to class and coming back. Then I'd say three or four times a week, she would have some... well through our Bloomington park district, the SOAR group, which is what special opportunities in recreation I think is what it stands for. A lot of kids who have some challenges, there's a lot of different activities. She has a fitness class on one night, maybe a food preparation class. What were some of the others? I can't even remember. Then every spring she's involved in the Penguin Project in McLean County, which is theater. Have you ever heard of the Penguin Project? No. It's a play that's put on completely by individuals with disabilities, and we have 80 people in the program, so there's 40 people with disabilities of all different kinds, ages 10 to 24. And then they get matched up with a typical peer anywhere from ages 12 to 24, and they put on a production and it's a three month process. Twice a week from end of February through the production in June, she would be doing that two of those nights a week. Then as you get closer towards the production, there's tech week, there's more rehearsals, and she always had a part in the play. Yeah, so she's really busy in May, for example. But at other times a year, she's involved in special swimming, special Olympic snowshoeing. Bowling. Bowling. On a typical week, she probably has three to five, maybe even a half a dozen of those types of activities. Mostly in the evening. And mostly in the evening in addition to perhaps school during the day. I'm trying to think if there's anything else we're leaving out. In non COVID once a week at Marcfirst. And then once a week at Marcfirst- For one hour. ... For an hour, Tell me what that is. I heard you mentioned it, but I was coming and going. We're really limited in blooming to normal on the services. Marcfirst is probably the most well respected of the organizations that we could have selected. They have two options, and one is I think, a day program, which it's not something that's probably a very good fit for Kira. We- We tried it. Yeah. It seems more like adult daycare than anything else, and so their other option is this one hour a week with a, I don't know, job coach transition specialist to work on job interviews, getting a job, all of those. It's supposed to move a lot faster than it does, but at our request because it was not going well, we asked them to slow down and get to know her because they were having behavior issues and, Paul. Yeah, it was a little bit like, \"Well, we need you to get the job as soon as possible.\" Kind of thing, before she ever even really could get her head around why she was even there. We purposely dialed it back because our mindset was really, we don't care if she gets a job in two years or three months, but we don't want it to be square peg in a round hole and force that. Yeah. And if we'd forced, it, she might have landed someplace that she didn't really belong, and then she'd be booted before- We didn't want them to push that forward when she wasn't ready. Absolutely. Yeah, we just asked them to work on their relationship with her because once you know, Kira, then you know how to work with her. She could've got a job with Walgreens, we would've done that immediately, but unfortunately, they're using that as a pipeline for other people when they're in high school. Oh, I see that . She would've been- Yeah. That job is- It's kind of awkward. That job is manufactured now to be part of that transition program. It's not a pipeline for her to get employment within a Walgreens. Even Walgreens is a great company that does employ people. But it is a little bit a pipeline for them to get free labor. Yeah. It does work both ways, right? Right. Yeah. Now when you talk about class, two or three times a week she has class. Is that at ISU? Yeah. Yes. Okay. I just want to make sure I knew exactly where it was. Okay. How many total hours would you say during the week does she attend both Marcfirst and the ISU classes? Well, I guess that would be probably about- How many hours a week? ... Three to four hours, I guess, total. Oh, yeah. Right. Okay. The classes are not very long at ISU? They're either one hour, three times a week, or I think when it's been twice a week, it's an hour and a half, so three to four hours and then another hour for the Marcfirst. Great. Okay. Three, four to five, I guess. That's perfect. I forget. I teach grad school and grad classes normally, and they're usually three hours and I was thinking, \"My God, they go two to three classes a week? That's a lot of class.\" Yeah. It's one class that it's undergrad. As a non-degree seeking student, she can take any gen ed class that isn't major specific that's open. Yeah. Got it. They just pick something that she's interested in that Paul, can wrap his head around, sitting in for three hours a week. Yeah. I guess, that's the last real big adverse to see I did was try to find a way to get her into Illinois State, and that was one way to do it. You don't have to submit ACTs and SATs, you just apply as if you're a transferring student basically, or a student visiting. Okay, and it's non-degree. What is the program called? Is she in a specific major . It's not a program. It's not a program at all. Any of her GPA can count towards admission to one of the colleges, but it's basically just a loophole where as long as you're willing to pay the tuition- The full price. ... And you're not asking to be admitted to any particular program, you're in. That's great. Kira, has self-identified. This is something that we told, I can't remember her name, Linda? Yes. Yes. Kira has self-determined that college is four years, and so she's going to be at ISU for four years. She's got two down. And she's got two down, even if it's taking one class a semester, what we have tried to instill is that she's not getting a degree, she's getting a college experience. Yes. Because all she ever wanted to do was be a college student, so she's getting to experience college without all of the other pieces that go along with it, like being full-time, or going towards a degree that she's taking classes that interest her. Great. What was she taking when COVID hit? Or what were the two of you? She was taking a class called ancient pyramids and lost continents, which was about conspiracy theories. I got an A. And she got an A, she got a legitimate A. She got an A and- Her first day. ... So it was a little bit of anthropology, a little bit of sociology. Yeah. It was interesting. She liked it. Yeah. She liked it a lot. Okay, great. Okay. Let me just make sure I get this right. Okay. Great. Asking for her area of study, I'm going to say college experience. There you go. Yeah. Most of her classes have been in the social sciences.  Probably my influence. That's her interest level, but also Paul's. She never would've taken world geography if I was the parent because I'm geographically challenged and she did amazing. That was her very first college class and earned a legitimate B. Everything else has been varying degrees, but the first and the last one have been really the greatest experiences for her. College is a mixed bag for everybody. Yeah. It totally is. Not one experience is ever all the way good. Now you don't have to take classes the whole time. Oh, right. Yeah. At least I didn't. Me neither. Not undergrad at least, because I had no idea what I was doing at that time.  Yeah. I see my master's . But going away. I think all my master's classes except stats were great classes. I struggled in stats as well and had to take it so many different programs. Okay. Month and year that she started the program at ISU. Well, that would've been fall of 18. Fall of 18. Fall of 18. Yeah. Is that right? Yeah. 18, 19, 20. Yeah. Okay. Fall of 18. Then in terms of supports, aside from Paul, you attending with her, does she get any other accommodation from the school? THey have a student accommodation services office at Illinois State. Three main things you can get from that, and she has two of these. She has a separate private testing, so she goes to a room in a different building and she gets double the time to take the test. She could have also opted to have a note taker, but I'm the note taker, so those are the supports she gets from the school. Yeah. We never asked if Paul could go with her- No, I'm just- ... They're lecture halls, and so they just show up. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. No one said anything, right?  Right. We just decided, we're not going to ask. We're just going to- Just beg for forgiveness if we ever get- Paul and Kira, after they start, meet with the professor and just- Yeah. They're usually aware, they're supposed to be of the situation, but most of these classes are 50, 70, 500 people. Okay. They're the big ones that you imagine in a lecture hall? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Then if we could talk a little bit about the Marcfirst program, I want to make sure I'm spelling... Is it spelled exactly like- M-A-R-C, and it's a acronym, It's one word, but I'm not sure what the acronym stands for. Yeah. We don't know, but even where we did early childhood or early intervention, she did it through Marcfirst that they had a program called SPICE, and I don't know what that acronym was for either, but one of the reasons why we went with them is we felt like it was a good place to be probably the most common one in our area that people utilize. Okay. What I got so far is she meets with someone once a week to work on building relationships and eventually job skills. Okay. Great. Sorry, you've answered some of these already. Sorry. When did she start this particular program? I believe she started that at the same time she did ISU. That's the fall after she finished her school district schooling. Right. Kira, ended the transition program before she could have stayed in it, but she determined she was done. I think she actually started this summer. Yeah, right after the accident. Probably June of 18. Okay, great. That's pretty cool that she's got all that agency that she was like, \"I'm done. I'm going to need something else. She's like, \"I'm ready to go to college. I'm done with this. This is-.\" Yeah. She could have stayed there another... well until her birthday that December and she was done. She said she was done. Okay. Great. All right. That was it for the vocational. When we're done-\n",
            "finishWhen he was in high school, did he ever work?  No.  Okay. And did he volunteer when he was in high school?  No.  Okay. Great. So then, when did he graduate?  graduated last June. Last June, okay. Right, because he's 22, isn't he? Mm-hmm . Okay, great. Where did he go, if you don't mind my asking? I know you live here, too, in Chicago. Where did he go to high school? Von Steuben. Oh, that's right. That's right. Yeah, that's right. Over by where I used to work. Okay, great. Okay, so now we're going to talk about, to get an idea of how he spends his time, I think I'm going to ask you to answer this question as if it's before COVID, because we're just trying to kind of get an idea of what life is like for him when things are normal.  Okay. So, can you tell me a little bit about the activities that he participates in during a typical week? Okay. When he was living in his group home  lived in a group home full-time. And I also need sleepovers at my house. I would love to, but he had to acclimate to his group home.  Yeah.  So, moving on, he would go... Mondays they would attend a program called Innovation, and that's by Orchard Village, and it was really nice. They would have group activities. They would go to different places and do volunteer work like the local library, the local shelter. They went to Amazon . How many days a week does he do this? Just Mondays? Or...? Mondays and Tuesdays. Okay. Okay. Then Wednesdays, Thursdays and Friday, he'd go to another place that he wouldn't need to take a  on, and that's called Gateway to Learning. And at Gateway to Learning, they have a bakery. They teach them how to bake bread. They have a place that kids can learn how to fulfill... where people can fulfill menu requests. Okay. So this is like a little- . Okay, go ahead. No, huh? They would take them out to different types of activities, like they would take them to McDonald's. One time they had an activity that they took them to the zoo. So, once a month, they would have an activity. I really love Gateway to Learning because they were much personalized when it came to my son. They let me know if he came in one day dirty or wearing clothes that didn't fit him or he smelled. And then I would call the... there's a person at Innovation, she's the house manager. She's not a nice person. Oh, no. She's very nasty. So, I hate talking to her. I really do. I'm a nice person. I hate talking to her. I bet. I almost  her boss and going over her. But she's just very difficult to deal with. The people that work in the house are nice. But the only person that makes it difficult is this lady. She's just a nasty lady. Yeah. Sorry about that.  But, yeah. So they'll call her. I wish that they could call me. So, he doesn't want them, they don't like her, and now my ABA therapists, because my ABA therapists are in the house, and the ABA therapist... their behavioral at Orchard Village is very lazy and doesn't enjoy her job. So, my ABA therapist has tried to train the people that work in the house try to work with my son. And-  Excuse me. Some of the staff members are like, \"Oh, yeah. This sounds so different,\" and other staff members, they've been there for a long time and why did they need... Why is there a customer doing your job? And they're saying why do they even bend over backwards and  for my son? You know what I'm saying?  Yeah. Absolutely. I had someone calling in to my... I had this guy, he doesn't know my classroom, doesn't know my staff. I have five . I have 11 kids and five CICOs-  Oh wow.  ...  in my classroom I manage. Since I was coming here, probably six CICOs. How many SPED teachers do you know that manage five CICOs. No, none. Okay, it's just me.  And I know a lot.  They come into my classroom and completely ripped on my classroom, he doesn't even know my CICOs, he does not know my students.  Mm-hmm .  They sent me in with four students this year with behavior plans. They're violent. Violent. Hit. So, this year, the majority of the year was addressing just the kids with the behavior plans because they were so violent.  Right.  They took my classroom and they made it into a different classroom.  Yeah.  So, it was just crazy. And my eights are getting beaten up, I get into  and hit and all this stuff, all this harm.  Mm-hmm .  So he would. And he went here, he would  year round. It's like, \"oh, they seem very bored,\" not knowing that what if he let the kid get out of his chair that he's going to go run out the door, or he's going to get up and go attack the kid in a wheelchair.  Yeah.  So, they came in and literally ripped out him and the assistant principal that know nothing about my classroom came in and completely ripped it out. Or they wanted to start doing rotations. This is for 5th grade, right?  Okay.  So ridiculous, the rotation. They have something for pre-school on Saturday. So, well, we won't be doing rotations this upcoming year.  No.  The only thing I could inform him is I'm going to get all my CICO's schedules and they're responsible for doing that . And I'm not going up to any students and getting attacked this year.  No, I don't think you should.  No.  The ABA therapy is done in the group home, how often, when does that happen?  That was being done six hours a week.  Okay.  And that was being done on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.  And during any of these days, does he have a job out in the community? Or...  No.  Okay.  Orchard Village wanted him to stop Gateway to Learning completely and have him go to Orchard Village everyday because it's, you know, Innovations is at part of Orchard Village...  Mm-hmm .  ... for several reasons. Number one, it's hard for them to put him on  is like how I see my students.  Yeah.  Because .  Yeah.  But I found Gateway, I found Orchard Village. Do you know .  And how many hours a week is he at both programs? How many total hours is he at Innovation and Gateway for Learning?  I think his days are hours. So it would be... half hours, 30.  Uh huh.  30 hours a week.  How many? I'm sorry, one more time?  30.  30 hours a week. Okay, great. Okay. And then, one more question on this one, after high school, was he ever enrolled in any sort of academic program at a vocational school?  No.  Okay.  Well-  Did he go straight to the CILA and the day programs?  Yeah.  Okay, great. All right. Perfect. Now, you have already mentioned, so the next assessment, is the services that you- \n",
            "finishOkay, thank you. Do you have any overall comments about it? About what? About the COVID. About the COVID. No. I've already said what I need to say. Yeah. Thank you. So now we go to the next sessions. Okay. Do you mind telling me, what does a typical week look like for ? How has he been spending his time? Okay. Well, a typical week would consist of... Well, he sleeps a lot, but then at the same time, sometimes he would wake in the evening. He will wake up at about 10 or 11, then he will eat his breakfast. Or sometimes he goes straight to... he's either doing his own coding. He is trying to finish a game or two for his own portfolio because he knows he's not in school but he needs to show something that he has done. So he spends a lot of time doing that. And then he spends a lot of time, when he can, when his friends are online, they chat and they play games together and sometimes they help him code his game. He's making his own game. And then he would watch videos. And he watches, with his dad, some movies, too, or a show that they're following. And then they would take a walk. His dad and him will take a walk for about, I'd say, 30 to one hour. And then he would, on his own, do his... like a martial arts exercise, basically, or jumping on his own. So that's probably about 30 minutes as well. And he probably reads a little bit of some fantasy books. And time and again, he would talk to us about his projects because he likes to talk about his projects whenever he'd come to us and talk to us about it. And we all have dinner together. He takes his medicine pretty early in the evening and he likes to go to bed early. Before that, I think he reads on his phone and then he goes to sleep directly from there. Okay. Thank you. So now he's on postsecondary education program. Do you mind telling me how many hour total hour during the  week does Bo spend participating in all of this educational activity? Right now he's not in formal education. He is on leave. Oh. How long has he been on leave? Well, this semester... He took one semester off when he got to university and then he went to one semester. And then he had problems with his math, so he took the next semester off again. So he has been on leave twice, two semesters. One semester on. Oh, he's on leave for two semester now? Well, yes, but he took a semester in between. Okay. Okay. So now he's no hours? No hours right now, nothing formal. But he's still planning to back to school next semester? He does. And this is where we're anticipating a little bit of stress going back to school because he needs to be up for that mathematics. That's why he needs the tutoring right now. So who is tutoring him now? No one? No, he's online. He does it online. He needs someone who could do it because I don't have higher math. When I did, it was decades ago. I don't remember anymore. I can't tutor him now. Okay. So is Bo currently enrolled in any academic program? He's on leave. Yeah, he's on leave, right? He is on leave. No. Yeah. What he's studying, he's studying on his own. No. Since last interview, but not currently. Yeah. So now he's on leave. Let me see. So can you tell me, is Bo currently participating in any employment, vocational, or volunteering activities? No. Okay. Now we go to next pages, next session. So during the first visit, we set three annual goals with you and Bo. The purpose of this goal development was to support family in helping Bo pursue his dreams for the future and really start working on this goals. Since about a year has passed, we would like to know how they're doing with this goals. Before we continue and discuss his progress, we feel it is important to say that we understand that a lot can happen in a year, and that the past year was especially unpredictable. We also understand that COVID might have imposed barrier to complete certain goals. So the first goal, we are focusing on following steps to attend a career fair. So within a year, Bo will take steps to attend a career fair, such as-\n",
            "finishIs Ethan still in high school? No. Okay. He  two thousand ... '16. '16. Oh, okay. Okay. So it's been a while. Has Ethan ever worked during high school? Intern. Okay. You had internships. First question is were the internships part of high school programming? Yes. How many internships, throughout high school, would you say? One. Oh, good. Okay. Did you get paid for the internship? No. Can you tell me the name of where the internship took place? I know it took place downtown Chicago, because I passed by  during my ride to work when taking the bus. It was another division of his high school. Okay. So it was at a different high school that was downtown? It was a different campus of his high school. Okay. How did you find the job or the internship? The high school set it up for him. Great. About how many hours a week did you work at this job? I don't remember exactly, but I think it was a few hours. It was six hours, I believe. Six hours a day for three days a week. Okay. So 18 hours. About 18 to 20 hours a week. Okay, great. Can you guys remember what month and year Ethan began working at this job? Yes. Let's see. That would have been ... I remember it was cold. It was the winter of two thousand ... It was junior year, so it would've been January through April, or January through March of 2015. Okay. Through March, you said, right? Okay. I went to say through March. Okay, great. Can you all tell me a little bit about the job and what you did there? I believe I did Excel work, Microsoft Excel. Okay, okay. For the school? I think so. Like data input.  Mm-hmm . Okay. Any other details? I think I had a hint of what office lunches are like, since I think we would go out to eat or something like that. Okay. Did you have a job coach or someone from the school working with you when you had this job? I think I might have had a job coach. Do you remember what the job coach did to help you? She would help me out with the Excel work at times. Okay. Mom, this question's for you. First, do you think this job was a good fit for Ethan's skills and interests? I think it was a good fit, because it allowed him to work with the computer, which he always loves to do, and concentrating on inputting information, making ... It was a good fit. Okay, okay. I don't know how to spell inputting. Okay. Next question. Did you volunteer at all during high school, in the community? No. Okay. The next part of this, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment and volunteering after high school. Okay. I know we talked about this a little bit last week. Some of this is a repeat. I apologize, but I have to just enter it in the computer as it's said. Can you all tell me, before COVID started, what would a typical week look like in terms of work, or going to any kind of programs after school, like training programs or anything? Okay. Before COVID, he will work one day a week, Tuesdays, from 10:00 to 2:00. Wasn't it Mondays? Was it Mondays? Okay. Mondays from 10:00 to 2:00, and possibly get called in for another day that week, to work another day for four hours, from 10 to 2:00. But before COVID, Monday from 10 to 2:00. At Walgreens, right, if I remember? At Walgreens, correct. Did he get any support, job support, job coaching, anything like that at Walgreens? In the very beginning, when he first started, he did have job coaches to be on the job, to steer them. It  Does he have anything now? No. Okay, okay. Now, post-secondary, on his own, just wondering, is Ethan currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in any academic programs out of a vocational school, community college or university, since high school? He was enrolled in community college twice. Okay. Can you tell me the name of the school? The first school was Richard Daley Community College. He was enrolled for ... It was a semester, but he only attended ... He never attended class, but he was enrolled for semester. We started the process at Harold Washington Community College, but he never attended. Okay. So he's been enrolled, but hasn't actually participated yet. Exactly. Okay, okay. Let me just make sure I put this in here right. Sorry. Okay. Okay. A couple more questions about Walgreens, please. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about what you do at Walgreens? I do stocking. Okay. You stock the shelves? Yep. Anything else? I also occasionally do computer work when called in to do so. What kind of work on the computer do you do? They are usually the kinds of stuff relating to Walgreens, so I would answer some questions. Like yearly competencies. Got it. So it's almost like a survey? Or more about the whole store? About the whole store. Like I know at work, we have to do yearly competencies in regards to rights and different acts. I guess in regards to the different policies of the store. Mm-hmm , okay. Anything else you did there, or do I have it all? I have stocking the shelves and occasionally doing some work on the computer. Great. How did you find this job? It was all right. No. How did you find it? It was through a teacher at his school, at his high school. Okay. So it wasn't through a transition program or anything. It was a transition program. She connected us through ... Okay. Illinois ID ... I can't remember exactly. Illinois Department of Human Services, so was a ... DHS. Yes. Thank you. It was a transition program from high school going into ... yeah. Okay. Do you remember the month and year that you started this job? I believe it was August, 2016. Excellent. Thanks. Very good memory. Now, Ethan, these questions are directly for you. Do you feel that this job is a good fit for you? Yeah. Why is it a good fit for you? Because it is simple, and the hours feels fair for me, but I would not mind working lot longer. Okay, great. Do you have anything else you want to say about your job at Walgreens? I think that's it. Okay. Have you participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteer activities since leaving high school? No. No. Great. All right, Ethan, we're done. I just have to speak with your mom and do one more assessment with her, but we don't need you here for that. If you want to stay, you're welcome, but I am done asking you questions. So thank you. You're welcome. Ethan, I'm sorry. One  I just forgot. I did send you an email, through your mom's email, with a survey for you to complete on the computer. If you don't mind doing that for me, then that's the last thing. I promise. It said, \"Ethan survey\". The email's marked, \"Ethan survey\". Okay. I'll send it to you so you can do the survey online. All right. Okay. Thanks. Thank you.\n",
            "finishAll right. So, that's the third form. So I'm just going to save that and move to our next one here. Okay. How many more are there? One. Okay. Okay. Please describe Levi's high school situation. Well, so he is not in high school right now. Okay. That was easy. Yeah. Did Levi's high school track plans change since we last spoke? I don't think so. Okay. Some examples of that could have been, planned on staying longer, but then decided to graduate sooner, chose a transition- No, Okay. Yeah. When did Levi exit high school? What month and year? I guess it was a year ago June. Okay. June 2020? 2020, yeah. Okay. And what type of diploma did Levi receive? Just his regular diploma. Okay. For the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that Levi attended since August 20th of 2020. First, I'd like to get an idea of how Levi usually spends his day. So let's talk about the activities he participates in during a typical week. What does a typical week look like for Levi and how has he been spending his time? So right now he's working full-time. So most of his day is spent at work. He will attend maybe a baseball game or a social event once or twice a week. So that's kind of it right now, honestly, work's been taking up so much time. Okay. So there's a list here and I'm going to select the activities that he's currently involved in. So volunteering in the community, is he currently- Okay. ... involved in that? No. Working for pay independently or working for pay with support? With support. Okay. Sheltered workshop or adult day program? No Vocational training program or unpaid internship? Paid internship, yeah, I guess it would be a paid internship. Okay. And any post-secondary education programs? No. Okay. How many total hours during the average week does he spend participating in all of these activities, vocational and educational? So just 40 hours a week for work. Okay. Okay. Now we'll talk about any school programs he attended after high school. Please discuss all post-secondary education activities since August 20, 2020. Is Levi currently enrolled- Okay. ... or has been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college or university since- No. ... August 20th? Okay. No. Now vocational activities, tell me about the jobs or programs, beginning with the current or most recent job and working back to the last time we spoke, last August. You said that he is currently participating in employment. Mm-hmm . Okay. And you mentioned it is working with support. Yes. And what is the name of the company, agency or business? Cyclomedia. And then, please describe the activity. So what does he do at this place? Good question. He can tell you way better than me. Something about mapping, plot . You said mapping? Mapping and something about plotting coordinates. I don't know, like a Google truck drives around and sends  stuff and then people have to go in and add the coordinates or something like that. Okay. So  part of it. And you said that he's receiving support? Mm-hmm . What type or types? I don't know. Sometimes an hour a day of job support. And from whom, is it a paid support staff, coworker, family? DVR. Okay. I'm sorry. His job support people. Yeah, Feist is doing that. And is he paid? Yes. How did he find this job? Through Feist. Through his job support program. How do you spell Feist? F-E-I-S-T. Okay. And you said 40 hours a week? Uh-huh . And what month and the year did he start this activity or this job? I think he's just finishing up three months right now. Okay. Yeah, and it's E-I-S-T, yes. Okay. So April? Yes. Okay. And was this a good fit for his skills and interests? A very good fit. Okay. And why? I mean, it was right up his alley, the technical part of the job. He didn't have to stand. What else? I think he was engaged and he really liked doing the work. The only issue was just the hours. 40 hours just, he could not... it's just too hard and they wouldn't allow anyone to go part-time. Okay. And is that why he's leaving? Yep. Because eventually we really want him to have his own place and we don't want him to be so exhausted at the end of the day that he misses out on social things. And he was just too ornery and too stressed about... Yeah, he was too tired. And you said that he was having less time for social activities with this many hours? Yeah. Yeah, he just started being reluctant to go out of the house at all at night during the week. He wanted to bury himself in his computer games. He was just so overwhelmed and that was just really  on him. Okay. And the transportation each way was sometimes like an hour and a half on some days and haven't hit bad weather yet, you know? Okay. Do you have any additional comments about this job? Yeah, I mean, they were going to offer... Some people do work from home part-time for the office, but that just wouldn't have been a good fit for Levi because he just would not have worked at home. It would've been me telling him that he has to do his work, and so that would've been disastrous. He really needs to defined, I work here, I don't work here line. Okay. We're almost done here, which is good for timing. Great. Okay. Has he participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since last August? No, nothing new. Okay. Is there anything else you'd like to tell us or provide any updates? I don't think so. I think that's pretty much it. Yeah. Okay. And lastly, is there any updates to your address? No, it's the same add. Okay. Oh my God, I can't imagine moving during this time. The market is insane. Okay. So, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today. Assist would not be possible without your participation. I'm going to go ahead and submit that form here and make sure we don't have any errors just as we're hitting noon. All right, it accepted it. Woo-hoo! I'm going to stop the recording now.\n",
            "finishAnymore? No. Okay. And then do you remember the year and month that he graduated high school? Yeah, it would've been June of 2016... 2018. 2018, okay. And did he receive a regular diploma? Yes. Okay. All right. So, we're going to move on to some post high school activities. Okay. What does a typical week for Noah look like right now? He's in school. He goes to lacrosse. He has some of his classes in person, some of them virtual. Okay. He knows the bus system really, really well. So, he takes the  out to eat a couple of times a week, at least. Yeah. That's about it. Out to eat. Yeah. Okay. All right. So, he is in a post-secondary education program and, let's see, does he do any volunteering in the community? No. Okay. How many total hours do you think he spends participating in educational activities? Probably 10. He just... part time because he couldn't handle the full-time. He was falling behind, so- Oh, okay. He switched to a part-time you said? Yeah. Grayson, please stop. Cool it down. Cool it down. So, that looks like probably six... five, six credits. Is that right? That very well, yeah. Okay. That was just... Grayson, please stop. Okay. All right. And so, currently enrolled. Yes. Can you tell me about the school? So, lacrosse, what program was it? Some history? Yeah. Okay. And so, history program, he was also in some... was in a archeology group. Is that right? He was, but he's  more. Okay. He doesn't do anything anymore. Okay. Is this a autism specific program? No. Okay. And this is a four year college for degrees? Correct. Okay. And then, so he was taking full-time, which I think is around 12 credits. So average number of classes he's taking per semester now would be- I think he has two or three. I think that sounds right. Yeah. He told me, I think it's two or three. So, he... Did he finish out his previous semester full-time and then switched to part-time or... Okay. Yes. Yeah. He even did some of like third quarter full-time also. Oh, okay. Finished previous semester- Literally just like a month ago. Grayson stop, please.  switch. Okay. Do you remember the month and year that Noah started at lacrosse? Yeah. So, it would've been September of 2018? No, no. 20? 2018? Yeah. Oh, okay.  Has he graduated in 2018? Yes. 14, 16, 18? Yes. Okay. And then you said he doesn't receive any supports from the program currently? Okay. No, no. There was things offered. We went up... I went up there with him three times before to work because supposedly that they had such a good, special needs program up there, was part of cares and that turned out to be a lie. So, they're... They don't do anything for him. It's... If he asks for it and then they... And I explained to them in the very beginning, I'm like, that's part of his problem is he doesn't self advocate. That's an autism thing. And like, well he's an adult he has to ask. I'm like, yep. But I told you in the beginning, if you say to him, Noah, you're going to do this. He will do this. And you said, okay. And all of a sudden I left, you got my money and it turned into, oh no, it's only if he asks for it. So no, he gets nothing and I'm beyond frustrated. Yeah. So... But he likes it, likes lacrosse. Otherwise I would love for him to... Would've love for him to transfer to Whitewater because they actually are amazing with supportive care, but what can I do? He likes it and it's so- He likes it. Yeah. So, do you feel like overall the program is a good fit for Noah? Like his history program? Yeah. I think so. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So it asks why you think it's a good fit. Cause he loves history and he already knows  the degree. Yeah. Basically. Okay. All right. He hasn't attended any other school programs since we last talk. Okay. Nope. Oh, okay. And then Noah is not currently doing any employment. Is there anything else you'd like to tell us, updates that you want to share? I don't think so. We covered it all. Okay. Yeah. I mean, well, his brother graduates from college next week with his master's out in Philadelphia. And so we're all going out and Noah didn't want to ride in the car for 14 hours. So, he is like, I'll just get my own flight. And I said, how are you going to get to Madison or Chicago from Lacrosse? Lacrosse has an airport. I'm like, oh, okay. They do. Yep. So he books his flights from Lacrosse to Minneapolis, from Minneapolis to Philadelphia, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, all right game on you, you're right. But he's resourceful when he wants to be, but at 6:00 AM on Sunday morning. So, how are you going to do that? I'm just going to go to the airport the night before and sleep there. I don't know if you're allowed to do that. He's like, I think I can. I'm like, okay. \n",
            "finishOkay Okay. That was the middle section here. We'll be going on to the third and final section. . So last time we spoke, we discussed some activities Owen has been involved in, and we would love to hear what he is doing now. Could you please describe Owen's high school situation? Is he still in high school or receiving services through the school system? Yes, still in high school and receiving services through high school. Did Owen's high school track or plans change since we last spoke? No. I mean, we just have the bumps with him being in the hospital right now and stuff like that, but it just has to do with his mental illness, but in general, he was supposed to remain in high school for as long as he could and participate in the transition program. When is Owen planning on exiting high school? The plans are that he will be in high school through 21. And then graduating in June, is that when? Yeah, so technically I think he's supposed to graduate in June, but still remain in high school. I haven't followed up too much on it because it's kind of a nightmare scenario for him, graduation ceremonies and stuff. So I don't know how much he'll want to do, and then with the schizophrenia, I mean, God help me if we don't find a medication by then. Yeah. But yeah, this year is technically when he's supposed to graduate. And then you said he's going into a transition program after that? Through the school, yeah. So he'll stay in the  , but it'll be transition. How long would that be? When would he be exiting the transition program? If you know. I'm not sure. He'll probably age out, and I think a lot just depends on what happens, probably more with his mental health than anything else, but either way he'll probably age out. Is Owen currently working? No. So, the follow-up to this is why is Owen not currently working. That's the schizophrenia. How he would've done at his job, I think it would've worked out, but I don't know for sure. Yeah. But definitely the reason is the schizophrenia, the safety for not trying it. Has Owen worked and left any jobs since October 20th 2020? No. Has Owen volunteered in the community during high school since the last time we spoke? No. Is there anything else you would like to tell us or any other updates you want to share? Nope. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk a with us today, as this would not be possible without your participation. That was actually the last question. Yay. Yes, I know. Thank you so much. You did a great job. I think the last thing I need to do here is just make sure I have the correct  - Okay. ...real quick and then just confirm that's correct. Before, I've been making people read it to me, and I was like, why am I doing, I can just look at what we have. Makes everyone's lives a little bit easier. Yeah. Okay. So this is the L-U-S-C-H-E-I family? Yep. Gmail? Yes. Okay. And then street address, 150 West Carol Street? Yep. In Portage. Okay, perfect. Then confirmed that is the correct one. Okay. Yeah. So that's it. Thank you so much for- . Okay. ...talking with me today. I really appreciate it. I hope you have a good rest of your day and hope Owen does well, and I hope that the doctors are able to help him out and figure out what works best for him. Okay. Thank you. You have a great  day too. Yeah. Bye. Bye\n",
            "finishSatisfied. So... The same as before and after COVID 19, were more dissatisfied. Okay. So that was the second section. I'm just making sure that I didn't miss anything here. Yep, perfect, nice job. That was the second section. So this is the third and final section. So, last time we spoke, discuss some activities. Ashton has been involved in and we would love to hear what he is doing now. Could you please describe Ashton's high school situation? Is he still in high school or receiving services through the school system? Yeah, he just started back to high school today. . Wow. Yeah. Or, yesterday, I'm, sorry, one day. And he is supposed to start getting services again in person, at school. Okay. Did Ashton's high school tracker plans change since we last spoke? I don't think so. Okay. We're still on the same game plan. Yeah. When is Ashton planning on exiting high school? June, July, whenever school's over. Yeah. I don't think... graduate early, but I don't. Okay. So June 20, 22 sounds right. Yeah. Okay. Is Ash, oh, you said this, Ashton's currently working, correct? Correct. How many jobs is Ashton currently working? Just one. Does Ashton receive payment at those jobs? Yes. Okay. So, now I'm going to ask more details about the paid job that he has. Okay. And you said he works at the chocolate shop? Mm-hmm . Does Ashton work at school or in the community? In the community? How did Ashton find this job? He just applied. It's close to our home. How many hours a week on average does Ashton work at this job? In the summer, he was work about 20. During school, it'll go to about 10. What month and year did Ashton begin working at this job? I think it was July of 2021, just this summer. Okay. Is this job part of school programming? No. Can you tell me a little bit about the job, job, title or duties, anything like that? He dips ice cream, he works the register, he does customer service. He's the ice cream guy. Perfect, thank you. Does Ashton receive support while working, do you think this job is a good fit for Ashton's skills and interests? Oh, yeah. Okay. And why do you think so? I think it's a little bit more of a quicker pace job than his old job. So I think that's good for him, and he has to work with more money and obviously be a little bit more, listen to what people need. Has Ashton worked and left any job since August 13th, 2020? Yeah, he left market . How many past jobs has Ashton worked in high school, since August 13th, 2020. Three. Three? He did also work at American Eagle for three weeks, so it wasn't as long. . Okay. And, I just want to clarify, this occurred since the last time we spoke? Yeah. Okay. Did Ash receive payment at these jobs? Yes. And how many jobs were paid? . Okay. So now I'm going to ask for more details about the past paying job Ashton held the longest, during high school. Okay. So, which one was that? That would be Marcus Theater? Okay. Did he work at school or in the community? In the community? How did Ashton find this job? EVR helped him, yeah. How many hours a week on average, did Ashton work at this job? About 10. And when did he begin working at the job? It was right after he turned 16. So, I would say November of 2000, or you 1999, I guess 99. Or, not 99. 2019? Yeah, that's the one. I've lost 10 years somewhere in there. And what month and year did he stop working at the job? That was June of 2021. Okay. And can you tell me a little about the job? Ashton was mainly an usher at the movie theater, so that was cleaning the movie theaters after the movie. And then he did work some concessions with the food. Okay. Did Ashton receive support while working? No. What was Ashton's reason for leaving this job? The pay and they shut down during the pandemic. Okay. And he was afraid that it would happen again. And do you think this job was a good fit for Ashton's skills and interests? Yeah, he liked... One of his interests is movies, and so he did like that part of it, and he was able to make some friends there. So, I think that was good. And, it was a slower pace job for the most part. So, it got him into the job market. Hmm. Yeah. Could you please describe other past jobs Ashton worked in high school? Sure. Ashton was at American Eagle, as a clothing sales person. Okay. For about three weeks, totally. Any other positions? Nope. That's it. Okay. Has Ashton volunteered in the community during high school, since the last time we spoke? Probably not since the last time we spoke. Okay. And, is there anything else you would like to tell us, or any other updates you want to share? Not that I can think of. Okay. All right. So, that was actually the last question. I just want to, the last little thing I need to do here is just make sure that the information we have for you is correct. So I'm going to go over what we have, really quick. Sure. And just confirm that nothing's changed or updated, and if it has... Okay. Okay, so, the email is still stephwasniewski03@gmail.com? Correct. And then, your street address, is it still 4211 Dawn Castor in Madison? Yep. Okay, perfect. That is all I needed. Thank you so much for meeting with me today. Sure. I hope you have a great rest of your day. Thank you . Thanks, bye.\n",
            "finishNo. . Go to the next portion. And I think I know the answer to this, but just to make sure I've got it right. So is your son still in high school? He is, yeah. And is he currently working? Yes. Where is he working? Or sorry, how many jobs does he currently have? Just one. One. And is he being paid at that job? Yes. And now where is he currently working? He works at The Chocolate Shop. So that's out in the community? Mm-hmm . And how did he first find that job? He just applied for a help wanted sign. And how many hours a week on average does he work at that job? I would say 12 to 15. And what month and year did he first begin working at that job? I'd say it was in the summer, so I would say June 2022 or '21, excuse me. '21, and is that job at all rolled into school programming? No. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about what he does at that job? Ashton is actually a shift manager and he's scoops ice cream. Great. And does he receive any support while working? No. And do you think that job is a good fit with Ashton's skills and interests? I think it's a good high school job. Okay. Did Ashton have any jobs that he worked and then left since September? No. And has he volunteered in the community at all since the last time we spoke? No, mainly due to COVID. Yeah, okay. Great. Any additional notes about school or jobs or anything like that? Nope. No, he's been trying to do some job shadowing but they found out to be difficult right now, so.\n",
            "finishIt takes my computer a second to kind of think because it pulls up the next form for questions. It's okay. Okay. So now we're going to talk about what a typical week looks like for Will. So how has he been spending his time? Okay. I'm sorry. Did you just add that question? Oh yeah. I'm going to ask you about what a typical week looks like for Will. How has he been spending his time? Okay. That's the question? That's the question. How has he ... . ... So sorry. Okay. Well he is back to working. He generally has a very fixed schedule, which is good for him. He works Monday, Wednesday, Fridays, 11:00 to 7:30 and he works every other weekend, 4:00 to 7:30. So, both days if it's one of his weekend works. Monday, Wednesday, Fridays, he generally wakes up and just kind of, he'll do some kind of chores around the house or just kind of hang out and gets ready for work and he's basically at work all day. Tuesdays and Thursdays are his days off where he's pretty much with me. We're working out. We generally, when it's nice, we try to get out and get some exercise, go for a bike ride or a hike. He did re-sign up for the gym. He likes the pool at the gym we go to. He does go to the gym now on Thursdays with a friend where I pick up another buddy that goes to the gym and they go together and stay for like two hours. He does that independently, which is kind of new prior to COVID. We always kind of went with him and just sort of sat at the pool with him, but now we're just letting him go. That's actually been a nice change. We just started that about two months ago. I mean that's about it. Because the days he works, he gets home so late, we kind of have dinner ready for him. So on the days he doesn't work, we're trying to work with him on kitchen and cooking skills and things like that. Tuesdays and Thursdays are kind of all about, what can we do for him as far as helping him become more independent. That can be anything from shopping or exercising or cooking or cleaning, that kind of stuff. How many total hours on average a week does Will spend participating in? ... It sounds like his job is sort of his primary. Yes. ... Vocational activity, I guess I should also ask, is he also doing any volunteer work or anything like that? No, not anymore. We did for a while with COVID we worked at Second Harvest. We would go do the care boxes that they were building, but then that's done now. That was at the Alliant and it kind of doesn't work with his schedule anymore. They were cutting down on the hours. So no. No volunteering, no kind of community things or anything like that. So then thinking about his work schedule, how many hours a week is he working? So a minimum of 24. And if it's a working weekend 30. So between 24 and 30 hours. Yeah. And that's a paid job? Yes. Yeah. Great. Is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in any academic programs, vocational school, community college, college or university since last time we spoke? No. Now can you tell me about jobs or programs? Sorry. I'm scanning through, because you've told me a little bit about the jobs, I don't want to ask you anything you've said. So yes, he's currently employed. Where is he working now? Oakwood Village. Same place. I know you described it to the last interviewer, but could you just give me a little bit about what he does at his job? Sure. He works in the back kitchen and he does dish washing but, I think now he also actually delivers meals to people's rooms when needed. They're very short on employees so honestly it's pretty good because I think he's going with the flow and trying new things. But, I don't know exactly everything he's doing. It's tough to get it out of him sometimes. Yeah. But I know he was hired to run the commercial dishwasher and that's one of his main jobs. And does he receive any supports in that job? No, just the monthly check-ins at this point. He did in the beginning, probably for a couple months, he had a job coach for the first two months of the job but then now it's just check-ins. Those are check-ins with Feist. Yes, correct? Yes. And he's paid, you said. How did he find that job, initially? Feist got him an interview there and he interviewed and got the job. Working 24 to 30 hours a week. And do you remember the month and year he first started working there? Yep. It was August of 19th. And do you think that job is a good fit for Will's skills and interests? I think it's a good starting job and it's a very good job for him in terms of the fact that the day is a very predictable routine day. Working in a kitchen you know when meal times are etcetera. Skill wise, I'd like ... I think that sort of goes back to the question about how did COVID change things. One of our goals was to have him visit different places, different jobs, different companies because he's kind of a visual kid and needs to see things to be motivated to do something different. That opportunity kind of doesn't really exist right now because I don't think all workplaces are back to where they are. Or if he wanted to visit a hospital, he probably couldn't right now because they're not letting random people in, just people who need to be there. So, skill wise, I would like to see more development, but right now that's kind of on hold. And any additional comments about that job? No, I mean, it's been great actually. I kind of take back what I just said. He has learned new skills, delivering meals to rooms, doing things, it's been a very good job for him. I think. Any other ... I know you said no, but just one more time. Any other employment, any other vocational, any other volunteer work? No. Okay, great. Go to the next form. Great. Now we're going to talk about the goals that you set. So during the first visit, we set three annual goals with you and your young adult. The purpose of the goal development was to support families in helping the young adult pursue their dreams for the future. And really start working on these goals. Since about a year's past, we'd like to know how they're doing with these goals. But before we continue and discuss this progress, I feel it's important to say a lot has happened in this year and the past year has been especially unpredictable. We understand that COVID might have impacted or imposed barriers to obtaining certain goals. So the first goal you set.\n",
            "finishLast one here. Okay. All right. Just making sure all of these bubbles are filled in because I missed one, so I'm going to make sure that it's filled in. Oh, okay. For the social activities that you mentioned, do you pay for some, all, or none of those services? You mean the Game Mate and stuff like that? Exactly. Mm-hmm . We don't pay. Okay. And how satisfied are you? Hugely satisfied. Okay. And interestingly,  actually likes the virtual Game Mates better than in person, because I think just on the way they have to be structured when you're on the computer, it's more structure. It's got to be real streamlined to get everyone playing the same game on the computer. And Sean loves structure, so it's... Yeah. All right. Great. So, that's actually been good. Okay. Now the last form here. Okay. Okay. So it starts off with education. The first question is: please describe Sean's high school situation; is he still in high school, receiving services through the system? I know you mentioned- No. No longer in school, so. Correct. Did any high school track or plans change since we last spoke? It doesn't sound like there's been any education since then? No. And when did Sean exit high school? What year and month? It was May of 2016. Okay. It was right before he turned 21. He went as long as he could, as far as the law would provide. But he had a summer birthdate and so the graduation occurred... So he did the 18 to 21 program, and then that ended right before he turned 21, because that's just the way the law worked. If his birthday had been a few months later, then he could have gone on for almost another year, but because his birthday was when it did, that's when it ended. And did he receive a regular diploma, occupational diploma, certificate of completion, or other? I believe it was the regular diploma. His class, in 2014, he walked across the stage. And then in 2016, after the 18 to 21 program, then he got his regular diploma. Okay. So now, for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that Sean attended since June 10th of 2020. And first I'd like to get an idea of how he usually spends his time. So let's talk about the activities he's participated... or participates in during a typical week. And so this question is: what does a typical week look like for Sean and how has he been spending his time? So like I say, the evenings are often pretty structured with Zoom stuff. Not always. I'd say half the time. During the daytime, he and I always go on a long walk, at least a 45 minute walk each day. Like I say, he kind of structures himself on... It's like he's actually into... he'll watch some... He loves church, so he'll watch... He has one time a month that he'll watch church on TV, but he does the online stuff too. But then it's like, he'll find YouTube videos where he'll sing along with church music. So he'll do some things like that. This is something since June that we got, is we got Disney Plus and he will then schedule sometime into watch a Disney Plus. He'll have some days where he'll have scheduled himself-\n",
            "finishSo he's not in high school anymore. There was no change in his track or plan because he was, sounds like he already had finished up with schooling by the last time we had talked to you. Correct. Yeah. And he's not receiving any services through there. So, he graduated 2000 ... 19. December of '19, yes. Okay. All right. Did he receive a regular diploma or a certificate? Looks like the ... or another? No, he got a diploma. Yeah. Perfect. Okay. So, post-high school activities, so he works currently how many hours a week? 30, you said? Said between 24 and 30 hours a week. Okay. Between 24 and 30 hours at Oak wood. And then about how many hours a week do you think he spends at the, oh my gosh. I keep wanting to say turning point. Point. Yeah. That's okay. So he's a turning point now, eight hours a week. Eight hours a week turning points. Okay. Any volunteering, other programs or work that we're missing? Oh yeah. So that's one thing. Gosh, that was a big positive during COVID. One of the first things we did was we went to the second harvest food bank, I out at the Allianz where they build the care boxes. Yep. And he loved that process. And so we did that once a week through the end of summer. That was a great, it was kind of the only thing you could like it certainly in March and April was the only thing you could do, like leave the house for, you know. I, we had a little pass to get in case we got like stopped or pulled over to show we were allowed to be on the road. So no. So we did that and then it was funny because we stopped going when turning point hit. Then all of a sudden in January when he stops getting physical activity, he starts to get anxious and I said, \"Will, do you want to start going again, like Thursday afternoons or something?\" And he really, really wanted to. So, we went again in January and February, like once a week, and now, now he is too busy now with work and everything he's too busy. Yeah, that was a big volunteering thing that he did. That's good. And he enjoyed it. Yeah, really liked it. Okay. All right. Okay. So to recap right now, he's working with pay, for pay with, technically with support because he gets the DVR check-ins right? Like once every- Oh, the IRS check-ins. Yeah. Okay. Any of these other, any I'm going to put volunteering just because that was really recent. Yep, yep. Okay. We'll probably get back to that when turning point ends. I mean- Yeah. In May, you said that's about to? Yeah. Okay. So looks like on average he spends about 38 hours a week participating in work or volunteers. Is that sound right? Yep. As of right now? Yes. Yeah. And all right, is it no, no community college stuff. Okay. Now we're going to go on his employment. So yes, he is currently employed with pay at Oak wood village, and so he does some dishes there? He runs, he's in charge of the commercial dishwasher. Yes. Oh, okay. In charge of dishwasher. I think he does general cleanup too. I don't know exactly why, but he's in the back kitchen. Okay. I know he maps the floor and takes out the garbage and he's got a few things. So this next one just says, does he receive supports while participating? It just sounds like the one, the monthly job. I'm told he doesn't, no. I mean, I don't think the job coaches would've left if he wasn't doing his job. That's kind of the, yeah. Okay. I'm just going to write that up. DVR initially sent him up, now does just check in. Then he found that through DVR, that job through DVR? Actually Feist Vocational found that for him. Yeah. So Feist is also the same company that runs Turning Point. They're, so they're the same group and they were his job coach and helped him, yeah. Through DVR, they hooked us up with Feist and Feist found him the job. Yes. Oh, that's great. Okay. Do you remember the month that William started at Oak wood? Month and year? It was August of 2019. August of 2019, so that would be, okay. Do you think that the job at Oak wood is a good fit for Will's skills and interests? I think it's a good fit for his skills and, for his skills right now. Okay. I think he can do more. Maybe it brings you back to the COVID question, but you know, Will was on a pretty good... If things hadn't stopped the way they had you know, certainly after doing the job he did for a year, we would've sort of been pushing like, okay, what's next? Can he possibly work in food prep? COVID definitely like delayed his progress. Sure. It definitely just stopped everything. Now I feel like we're getting back on the train again, and my thoughts are, 'in the fall, we'll start the discussion of \"what are some other jobs or skills that he can learn in this environment,\"' because I think the environment is very good for him there. Yeah. The scheduling is ideal. His schedule never changes. He knows he works every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and every other weekend, that's it... It never changes. Yeah. So that's a big deal for him. Okay. I think right now the answer to that is yes, yeah. Okay. Eventually something... Pushing that next step eventually, but for now... Right, right. Just learning some other skills. Yeah. Yeah. There's lots to do there. Okay, great. Okay. Any additional comments about the job at Oak wood village? Nope. Nope. I mean, it's been a good place for them. It's been very good. Yeah. Okay. Now last thing I'm going to go through is just the second harvest stuff. I might have all the information I need, so let me just see here a second on this. That was filling those food boxes or were you handing them out? No, we were filling them. Filling. Yes. Did he receive supports when he was doing that? Yes and no. I mean, I was there with him and I would just kind of show him what to do, but once I showed him, he knows what to do. Okay. Not paid? Correct. That was volunteer. I'm going to put currently, let's see, April. Doesn't currently do it, but you're probably going to start back up. Yeah. How did you guys find about, find out about the second harvest opportunity? Just through the news. And then, so he was, you guys were doing about eight hour or how many hours let's see here? Oh, we would just go once a week for four hours. I mean, I would say maybe he's done it, I don't know, he probably did it 16 times, let's say. Okay. So far? Over the course of the past year, yeah. He did stop once September hit and... Okay. We did it pretty much every week from April through August, but probably missed a week here and there. Maybe 20 times, 20 times. I actually, maybe I'll put that he's currently in this just because you guys are still within the system and you're... They know him. Yeah. Do you feel like that volunteer opportunity is a good fit for Williams skills and everything? That was really, yeah. It was a great fit. Yeah. It's like an assembly line. It was very well organized. To the comment about work, it actually sort of made me think, he, he would be great in an assembly line. Okay. Like do this... Hey, let's let him out real quick. Oh sure. No problem. Wow. Yeah, it did though. Make me realize there's a couple things we know about Will with work and that is that he needs to be moving. He could never sit at a desk or... Some people, they would love that, but he needs to be moving and really an as like watching him do the food bank work, it was like, wow. If there was an assembly line he could be on, he would be really good at it. It shows some other skills that he could do. Any other participation in employment or other volunteering things that we missed? No. Okay, and anything else you want to share? Any updates? No. All right. Think so. Yeah. Very good. Well really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us today. You'll get a message from Sarah on the payment. Oh, that's okay. Then just to make sure, is the email that I emailed you at for this link, is that still the preferred email? Yep. Okay. Yep. That's good. All right. Well super. Okay, great. Glad you're able to make it. Thank you so much. Yep. No problem, Ashley. Thank you. Yeah. Have a great rest of your day, goodbye.\n",
            "finish... Last time that we spoke, we discussed some activities  been involved in, and we like to hear about what she's doing now, so we're going to start with high school experience. I know you said last time, Sabina's not in high school. But is she receiving any services still through the school system? No. Okay. Did anything about her high school track or plans changed since last time we spoke? No. Can you tell me when Sabina exited high school? Oh, wow. 2014, I think. Okay. 2014. Would that be May? Do you remember the month? June. June. Okay. That was when she was done receiving any sort of services through high school? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Great. Do you know what type of diploma Sabina had? Just a regular diploma. Great. Now we're going to talk about post high school activities. I'm going to ask you about academic programs, employment, and volunteering that Sabina attended since the last time we spoke, which was June of 2020. First, I'd just like to get an idea of how Sabina usually spends her time. Let's talk about activities she participates in during a typical week. What does a typical week look like for Sabina? She works Monday through Friday, 10:30 AM to 7:00 PM. She eats dinner with the family, and then usually spends time watching TV with us, and goes to her room. Monday, she's responsible for cooking dinner. Fridays, she's responsible for picking up our groceries. We often get together with family on the weekends. I should say with my mom, excuse me. We haven't seen our extended family since, my God, January of 2020, I think. That's it. She doesn't go anywhere or do anything. Okay. Can you remind me where Sabina's working right now? She's working for Exact Sciences. I remembered reading that she worked there, but I couldn't quite remember if that was her most recent job or not, so thanks for that. She works there independently, she doesn't have a job coach or anything like that? Okay, great. How many total hours a week would you say Sabina spends in all of her vocational educational activities? 40. Great, great. Now I'd like to talk about school programs that Sabina attended after high school, but just since the last baseline. Is Sabina currently enrolled, or has she been enrolled in an academic program, vocational school, community college, or university since June of 2020? No. Okay. Can you tell me more about... Sorry, give me a second to read through this to make sure I'm asking the questions correctly. I appreciate your patience. This is one of my first interviews, so I'm still kind of learning this stuff. Oh, you're doing great. Thank you. Okay. Sabina is currently employed by Exact Sciences, which we said, which is independently. Can you go over what exactly she does at Exact Sciences? She's in the customer care call center. When the agent that you get the first time can't answer your question, and you know how they put you on hold? They will call Sabina and ask. She's the next level of support in the call center for what they call exceptions or problems with the Cologuard kit. Cologuard? Yes, it's an at home colorectal cancer screening kit, and that's Exact Sciences' big product. Okay. Got it, got you. She has expertise on that product? Right. Got you. Expertise in solving problems with the kit, or insurance, or doctor's orders, or... What else have I heard her talk about? Shipment, or things not getting there, things that get there too late, and then the samples are bad, and they've got to redo it, those kinds of things. Got you. Okay. Great. You said she doesn't receive any supports for that, and she's paid for that. How did she find that job? I heard about it on the radio and told her to apply. Great. Do you remember the months and year that Sabina started this activity? I remember October. She was working there when I was still... 2018, I think. Okay. Oh, my computer's thinking for a second, but I know the next question is going to be... Oh, I did something I totally wasn't expecting there. Give me just one second. Sure. Okay. Do you think this is a good fit for Sabina's skills and interests? Yes. I'm surprised that she does well at this, actually. Oh. Maybe because it requires her to problem-solve on her feet, which is difficult for her, and then verbally communicate clearly technical information to another person, and do all that. They're timed. Yeah, yeah. All that's hard for her. Actually, I'm surprised. She's just very brave. Yeah. Great. Any other employment, vocational, or volunteering activities that she's done since June of 2020? No. Okay. Anything else you'd like to tell us, or any other updates you want to share that we haven't covered in any part of the interview? No, I don't think so. Okay. Well then, the last thing I have to do is just verify that I still have the right email and mailing address. I know I've been emailing you some reminders. Is that the correct email? Yes. Has your mailing address been updated? No, it's still the same. Great. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us today. This would not be possible without your participation. I know that the next step is going to be , who's supervising me on this project, is going to be emailing you soon with some follow up, is the next thing that'll be happening. Okay, great. Great. Thank you so much. Thanks. Have a good rest of your Saturday. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.\n",
            "finish... For the year and month that Alex graduated from high school? It was in January, I think 2017. I think January 2017. Okay. And then did he graduate with a regular diploma? Yep, regular. Regular? Okay. All right. So then these will be about post-high school activities. You said he currently does one course a week with volunteering for the- Dog rescue. Dog rescue, yes. And then you mentioned the Special Olympics for softball and hockey. He is participating in both of those or is he volunteering for one of those? He's participating. Okay. So how many total hours would you say Alex spends between volunteering and his coursework? A day? Yes. Actually, sorry, how many total hours during an average week? During an average week? Probably about 15. 15? Okay. So he is currently enrolled in a program, the name is MATC, right? Yeah. Madison College. What is the course that he's taking? I don't know the exact name. It's an ethics course. He's on a general requirement. Oh, okay. It's not towards a degree, correct? It's just taking some classes within the program? He is working toward a degree, just very slowly. Oh, sure. He's actually working toward getting a physics degree at UW. He was actually doing really well until COVID hit and then things fell apart. It's really hard with him because when he's stable and things are well, he does really well in class, but then almost every semester then we have to drop some classes because he's not stable or he's not doing well mentally. But he was doing well and then that happened. So we went back to our true and tested MATC to get some more general requirements. Last semester he did take one or two classes at the UW, I think. Okay. He's still taking some math and physics classes. I'm making some progress toward that, but it's just very small. Just one or two classes per semester. I have no idea when he'll graduate, but I'm not putting a timeline on it. Yeah, no problem. Okay, that makes sense. This is not an autism or a disability-specific program, correct? It's just typical degree programs? Typical, yeah. Okay. What type of community college? Working towards a certificate. He's at a four-year college, working towards a degree. So physics would be his ultimate area of study? Right. And then he's taking one to two courses per semester? Right. Part-time. Do you remember the month that he started this program? Not really because he's always been taking college courses since he was in high school. He's always had this goal, but he wasn't able to get into the UW until his GPA was . He's always been able to work on it or been working toward it since high school. Okay. Do you remember the year that he was able to officially take a class at UW? They always let them take a class at UW as a specialist student, but as a regular student, I think that was last year in 2020, yes. 2020? Okay. As a special student, and by special, it's not special ed. Yeah, it's just outrageously expensive, rather than a regular student. Okay. Is Alex receiving any support from the program like McBurney or any other disability support? Not currently, just because there is no activity occurring on campus. It's really hard to even access McBurney to get their passport. I forget what they call it. We are hoping once they start in person. He started taking up classes at UW this summer and then dropped it, so it wouldn't even apply any longer, right now. In the fall he's going to start a class and that would be in person and we will be going through McBurney, yes. Gotcha. Okay. Do you feel like this program is a good fit for Alex? Yes. At his own pace, yes. Okay. Again, it requires for him to stop and go many times, as his mental health allows, but it definitely is what he really likes and he does have a true talent for physics. That's great. Yeah. Okay. There's not any other school or program that he has attended outside of the MATC and- And UW? And UW, right. So he is participating in some volunteering. Volunteering in the community, I'll put, although some of it's at home. Do you know the name of the company for the animal rescue? Yeah. Paddy's Paws, P-A-D-D-Y. Paddy's Paws is one of them. And then the other one, we do it through two of them, the other one is Lola's Lucky Day, Wisconsin. Okay, Lola's Lucky Day. And both are for fostering dogs where he just takes care of them? Yep, he takes care of them. We have them at home until... They come from Houston. I usually do, not all of them, some of the transports from Houston. When they arrive, they either go right into adoptive families or foster families if we don't have adoptive families. So they often come to our home and we have one, two or three. He's shown to have a remarkable talent and developed empathy and responsibility for taking care of dogs that often come from very horrible backgrounds and are neglected. It's just been good all around for him and for the animals to work on this. We've been doing that now for two and a half years. It's been a great experience. That's awesome. So it sounds like he doesn't receive any support while participating in this. Nope. Is he paid at all or is this totally- No. How would you say that Alex found this job or this activity? We had rescued a dog from one of those rescues and that's how we got interested. They had a need and then we decided to do it. He had had a very bad episode, a crisis with his schizophrenia and he needed help coming out of a really deep depression. I just thought that this would be a good way to help him out of it. It has been very therapeutic and he has certainly developed a lot skills from it. He's been great with it. That's awesome. Okay. And then just for this volunteer activity, how many hours per week do you think Alex participates in it? When we foster them, they live at our home, so it's an everyday thing, but purposeful working with them, I'd say he puts in a good two hours every single day. About 15 hours a week. Okay. You said this started about two years ago. Do you remember the month by chance? Yeah. It would've been March 2019. Okay. Yeah. So hasn't participated in any other volunteering. Any other updates that we haven't covered today that you'd like to share? No, I think that pretty much covers it. I think that this whole exercise has been very helpful overall. For us to know more about the different programs that exist and what not just him, but also his sister, could have access to. So I just wanted to thank you guys for doing all the heavy lifting and all the work. I appreciate it. I have actually shared information with a number of other people. Oh, we'd love to hear. . That's great. Oh, I'm so glad that it's been helpful. We really appreciate you taking the time because I know it's a little time consuming to do this, but hopefully it'll be worthwhile so that we can get this out to more families and more people in need. The last thing, do you prefer the email address that we were emailing through? Is that still your current email? Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Actually, I might have it, let me just see, I just want to double check that we have the right mailing address too, so that we can get those payments out to you when they're able to do that. It's 3833 Clover Lane, in Madison 53714. Okay, perfect. Okay. Well, that's all I need, I think, from you, Natalia. Thank you so much. We really appreciate you. Hope you have a good rest of your day. Yeah, we appreciate you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.\n",
            "finishOh, I must have forgot one. It's telling me I can't go on yet. She can't move forward until you finish that one. Yep. Oh, it just needed me to say no for one of them, for the, have you experienced any other changes from COVID 19? Okay, so now we're going on and this one's about Rowan's schooling. So last time we spoke, we discussed some activities Rowan had been involved in, so currently, Rowan is still in school, correct? Summer school. Still in summer school. And that's through the local district? Correct. Okay. Could you describe Rowan's high school situation? Does Rowan receive services through the school and when is the graduation date? So Rowan does have an IEP. Okay. So he does receive services. He has a case manager, a support teacher. He does have some modifications via the IEP to his schoolwork, although he is mainstreamed. Okay. And graduation hopefully, will be June 2022. Okay, okay. So yes, still in high school and then the trajectory for Rowan's graduation, has it changed since we last talked? Well, if he doesn't pass this summer class, it will. Okay. But as of right now? But as of right now, he is on track. Okay. So I'm just going to add that in here. Okay, so June 2022, is back to date, and then he will graduate with a regular diploma, correct? That's correct. Okay. And then is Rowan currently working or still working on services with DBR? Still working on services with DBR. Okay. And then had Rowan left any jobs since we last talked, it didn't look like he was working the last time. Okay. And then any volunteering in the community? I know it's a weird time for volunteering. No, not at this time. Okay. All right. Great. So anything else that you'd like to share with us or updates about you, Rowan or other family? Well, other than we all survived COVID and being sequestered and isolated. And while it did have some effects, I think there's a maturity to him that seems to be surfacing. Yeah. That's good. The other side. Okay. Okay. And then lastly, just to verify the email that I had sent to you, is the email still your primary email that you'd like us to send information to? Yes, please. Okay. And then would you verify your mailing address? Sure. So my mailing address is, 1011, Jana, J-A-N-A, Lane. And that's Madison, 53704. You might have Randall's address there, I'm not sure, the Middleton address. It just kicked me out, so I have to do it again, of course. Okay, let me just see here. Oh yeah. 1011, Jana Lane. Jana Lane. Okay, perfect. Okay. I think that's all that we needed today. Quick and simple. So thank you so much, Tracy. Thank you. Thank you for that we were part of the program. I think it was very informative. Yeah. Oh, good, I'm so glad. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you. You too. Bye-Bye. Bye-bye.\n",
            "finish... Still in high school? Yes. Yeah. What is the intended graduation date for Quincy? 2023. Okay. Then, is he receiving any services through the school system? No, no. Graduation is 2023. Okay. Do you think that Quincy's high school track or plans have changed since we last spoke, or do they seem similar? Oh yes. They did change? Well, he's going to a different school. Oh, okay. That will hopefully his needs. His plans are still to go into culinary arts, but his path is looking very different. Sure. Plans still to go to culinary School. The path is different. The switch in school, did it extend any time, or did it just kind of change the classes, and teachers, and services? Yeah, that. Okay. The year that he's going to plan to exit high school is 2023. Month? Would that be May or June? June, I would imagine. Okay. Any other notes about his high school exit? His planned high school exit? Anything to note about that? I don't think so. Okay. Quincy is not currently working right now? Correct. Okay. The next , why is Quincy not working? Because it's a pandemic and I don't let him. That's a perfect answer. No, he is actually fully vaccinated. If he wanted to work, he could. Sure. I don't feel he is capable of doing it. Getting a job and keeping a job without some sort of support. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Has Quincy left any... He didn't have any jobs previously? Yeah. No. Then, any volunteering? No. Okay. Let's see. Anything else that you would like to share with us, or that you think is important about his work, or anything else at all? I'm curious what the future will hold for him. He's hard set on going into culinary arts. He's been that way since he was a toddler, although, his skills and strengths lie in math and science, particularly math. With the restaurant business, the one we thought would always be stable, we now know isn't. I hope that he chooses to get an education that will allow him a fallback plan, although, he doesn't seem interested in that. I guess we'll see how passionate he is to stay committed to going through school and working in the food industry. It will be interesting to see if he continues to follow that plan, or if he considers it not necessary and just goes the way he's going. Yeah. I think he would be more engaged in school if he could take college classes in math and sciences, and be more engaged and not bored. Sure. Okay. Okay. All right. Is the email that I sent these links to, is that still the primary email, and okay to email? My full name, ? Yes. Let me just triple check here. Yes. Okay. Okay, so thank you so much for taking the time to do this. It wouldn't be possible without you. Is there or anything that we missed that you want to cover? Otherwise, you are free to go, and we really appreciate it. I am curious about the payment. I'm not doing it for the money, but since it's offered, fair is fair. Were we only supposed to receive one payment so far, and the kids none? Is that... It looks like on the sheet... It looks like I should have gotten two, and Quincy should have gotten one. Yes. Sarah  is in charge of the payment system. What I'm going to do is, I will message her that you have... You're just wondering about it. Certainly that's definitely part of this. She can follow up with you. I know that some of the payments were being delayed because there was a tornado at our sister school, and it caused some mess up. I don't know. I thought that was a little while back, so I don't know if that's been fixed or not. I'll just link you two up, and let her know that you're wondering about it. Okay. Does that sound okay? Yeah. Thanks. Okay. Awesome. Well, you have a great rest of your day. Thank you so much, Michelle. When's the next step? What's the next step? Oh yeah. That's a great question. For . Let me take a look here. The next step is that, Sarah should be... I mean, the next step for this is, Sarah should be contacting you about the payment for this one. We have another follow up at 12 months for both you and Quincy. The 12 months falls when? That's a great question. . 12 months... When did he start here? This is six months, right? Yes. Okay. So, six months from now. Six months from now, it should be. Yes. I can double check that with Sarah as well. Okay. That's fine. Yeah. But as far as I understand, that should be- That'll be different, then. Yeah. Sarah is the leader in all of that work. Definitely when I hook you up with her for the payments- Oh my God. I just remembered something. Oh. My aunt called because she was supposed to pick Quincy up from school, and Quincy didn't go to school. Oh, no. Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry. Okay. Good luck. Bye. Thank you. Bye.\n",
            "finishWe are on our last part here. So, last time we spoke, we discussed some activities Mitchell had been involved in. So, just love to hear what he's doing now. We'll start by talking about his high school experience. Would you describe Mitchell's high school situation? He's still in high school right now, correct? Yes. Yeah. Still in high school and still receiving services through the school system, although he is not getting the para you mentioned? Right. Yeah. Is he planning on attending a transition program through the school system or vocational skills training program through the school system? Anything like that? Not through the school program- Not through the school- Or school system. All right. And then did his high school track plan kind of change since we last spoke? Or, so that would be if he's planning to stay longer or graduate sooner? No has not changed. Then when is he planning on exiting high school? I believe June 6th is their graduation date. June 6th. Mm-hmm . Turn up so quick. Yep. Is it going to be virtual graduation or in person- They have not said anything. Which is rather disturbing. Because, do we have a party for him or not? And when would we do this? Yeah. So high school employment, you said he's currently working. Does he still have that one job at Willy Street Co-op? Any other ones? No other ones? No other ones. And then he's paid for the job at Willy Street, you said, right? Yes. So I'll ask a little bit more questions about that one. So he works at Willy Street and that's the Monona one you said? Middleton. Middleton. So that would be in the community, not at school. Then how did Mitchell find this job? It was through VR- DVR. How many hours a week? You said- 10. 10. Do you know the month and year that he started working at this one? Well, the internship started in October, but he was hired in January. I think I'll put that October date since you said he was getting payment through... DVR. So this job is not part of school programming. It was outside of that. He told me that he does kind of the filling of the bulk items for most of it. Customer service and bagging for the other part. Currently, he doesn't receive supports while working, correct? Correct. Do you think that this is a good fit for Mitchell's skills and interests? For skills. Maybe not for interests. So now we're going to move on to Hive. So he left that job... In October. In October. Please indicate Hive... A community. How did he find that Hive job originally? Same. DVR? Mm-hmm . How many hours did he work? Maybe six to eight. Six to eight? Do you remember when he started that job? Yeah. I want to say, maybe October 2019. You told me he stopped that one. That one was mostly bagging. He didn't really have any other duties. Did he receive supports while he was working there? Yes. Not the entire time, but much of the time. So was that a job coach or a support staff? Or what did that look like? Job coach. And then what was Mitchell's reason for leaving Hive? For more hours and to be closer to his residence and in his community. Did you think that Hive job was a good fit for his skills and interests? Somewhat. Somewhat For, first jobs. He likes art so it's just kind of hard to find. Has Mitchell volunteered in the community during high school? Since the last time we spoke? No, not since. Well, that's kind of hard with COVID. Yeah. Is there anything else that you'd like to tell us or any other updates that you'd like to share? No. That's it. Thank you so much for taking the time. Definitely not possible without your participation. I just wanted, before you go, just verify your email again. Let me pull up the one that we have, just to make sure. We have K R Y S I A, B R A U N. gmail.com. Yes. Perfect. Okay. Thank you so much. Have a great rest of your Sunday. Yeah, you too. Bye bye.\n",
            "finishI'd say the same as before, as far as the services we are getting. Okay. So this completes our second form, I'm going to move on to our third one here. Please describe Ben's high school situation. Is he still receiving services through the school system? No. And did Ben's high school track plans change since we last spoke? His high school plans? Yes, and so did Ben's high school track/plans change since we last spoke? Well, yeah, no, it hasn't changed, he hasn't been in high school for three years now, so. Yeah, when did Ben exit high school? The month and year? It was June. Let's see, three years ago, so that was 17. And what type of diploma did Ben receive? A regular high school diploma. Okay. For the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, volunteering activities, that Ben has attended since May 29, 2020. First I'd like to get an idea of how Ben usually spends his time, and we'll talk about the activities he participates in during a typical week. What does a typical week look like for Ben? How does he spend his time? Just currently, right now? Yes. Okay. He's pretty much here, and he spends most of his time, I would say, using his iPad, he does some reading, he does do some artwork. I try to gauge him as much as possible. He does do some regular exercise. He does yoga with his dad, and runs on the treadmill, walks on the treadmill. I pulled out some old, some electricity kit, whatever else I could find, that's away in the closet. He does help me with some baking that we have done. So, those sorts of things. Okay. And then looking back beyond currently, so time since May 29th, 2020, has he been spending his time in additional ways that you haven't already spoken about? I try to get him out of the house sometimes, with some grocery shopping occasionally, doctors visits if necessary. What else? Occasionally, if we need to go to a store, but that's not very often. And again, I try to work with him. I've been working on tasks here around the house, and do some teaching, as much as I can around things like social awareness, focus, I like to focus with him a lot on his understanding of people's thoughts and motivations. So, that's primarily all. Thanks for sharing all of that. Mm-hmm . And is Ben currently volunteering in the community? No. Is Ben currently participating in any vocational or educational activities? No. Okay. Now we'll talk about school programs that Ben attended after high school, and I know that you spoke to Ben having graduated with a regular diploma. Is Ben currently enrolled, or has been enrolled, in an academic program at a vocational school, community college, or university? Yeah, he was. Okay. And was this since our last interview on May 29? No. Okay. No, it's been a couple years. Do you know what year that was? Oh, gosh. It's okay. I'm terrible at . I can say a couple years ago. Gosh. When did he graduate? 18, I think, 2018. Okay. And what program was this? Vocational school, community college, university? It was community college. Okay. Now, can you tell me about jobs or programs, beginning with the current or most recent job or program, working back to the last time we spoke on May 29th. Is Ben currently participating in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities? No. And has there been any participation in these since May 29th? No. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates you would like to share? Nothing other than what I've already told you. So that concludes our interview for today. Thanks so much for taking time with us, an assist would not be possible without your participation. And before we end the call, I want to verify your current email address and mailing address. Have there been any changes? . Okay, wonderful. So I'm going to go ahead and save that form. Great. And, 9:16, we finished early. Okay. Thank you so much. I'm going to stop the recording now. Okay.\n",
            "finish... aren't able to do that at the transitions program, but every time I've asked, it's been because it's perceived as academic and their job is to do life skills and vocational skills. Okay, great. There's a lot of great information, so I might sort of ask you some questions and then realize that I've got the answer somewhere else, so- No problem. I was specifically detailed, because I want this study to know about stuff. Yeah, definitely. That's super helpful, thank you. This is tough because you mentioned thinking about appealing something in the future. But didn't Nicole's high school track or plans change since the last time that we spoke? No. Okay. The plans were transitions. Transitions changed because of the pandemic. Right, okay. Did I answer your question? I think so. This might also kind of go into this next question. Right now, when is Nicole planning on fully exiting high school? Oh, caught you, and got you now. Right now she's slated for '21, so she's slated for only one more year. Okay. That would be May of 2021, June of 2021? June of 20... No, June of '22. '22, okay. Oh yes, because that would be this year if it was '21. Think about appealing but that's the current situation and that plan has not officially been changed yet, correct? Correct. Okay. I think we're going to have to wait for legal precedent on how other districts and states and the federal government responds to essentially special ed lawsuits around how much was lost in this year, and then what their responsibility is to make up for it. Typically, I would completely support the idea that Nicole should be exited at '21. But this year was so decreased in her services from the school standpoint, that she's not going to be a year from now where everybody on the team wants her to be if she had had two full years of transitions. Okay. I know Nicole is not currently working. Correct, but has a job held for her and hopefully she'll stabilize enough to be able to attend it in June, and school will support her. Yeah. But we do have to talk about... She had jobs that she left. Between May 11th of 2020 and today, I know you mentioned the Dollar General Store. I think also I was looking at your last form and I think she was working at Walgreens last time that you spoke as well. There was Dollar General, Walgreens, were there any additional jobs? No. Pre-Walgreens, but you don't care about pre-Walgreens, do you? Yeah. This only between last time you spoke and then today. No. Then what happened at Walgreens is it was really only an internship, and then when the internship was over, they chose not to hire her because she wasn't really ready. I mean, I get why they made the decision. But then that vocational agency found her the position at Dollar General and they were willing to hire her, so she was actually hired and being paid by Dollar General until this weird management change happened, which I do think is COVID related. . Okay, give me just a second because that this is just not happening in exactly the order it's laid out, so I want to make sure I get to everything. No problem. We've talked about these two jobs for both Walgreens and Dollar General, was she paid for that work? Yes, but by different agencies. Okay. They were DVR dollars... Or no, does DVR pay her? Does DVR pay the job coach? I think DVR paid her. Yeah, there was no Walgreens. So somebody else, some government entity, I think DVR paid her while she was at Walgreens. At Dollar General, it was dollar general corporate. Okay, great. Just wondering. It's format in such a way, I'm just wondering if I should have done... Where I should put each job, but I will just ask you about both for all these questions and I'll put them- It's okay, I'm in rush. ... we'll figure it, okay. Yeah, whatever makes it  from him. Football , was that an at school job or an in the community job? In the community job. Okay, and same with Dollar General? Correct. Do you know how Nicole found the job at Walgreens? Yep, that was from Feist Vocational Agency. What about Dollar General? Same organization. They found Dollar General for her once Walgreens didn't hire her. Once the internship was over, Walgreens didn't hire her, she was still their client, so they found a new job at Dollar General, and then Dollar General from the beginning, agreed to hire her. They didn't need the three-month internship time. Got you, okay. At Walgreens, how many hours a week on average did Nicole work? Two. Okay, and at Dollar General? Two. What month and year did Nicole begin working at Walgreens? February, 2020... Wait, she was working there May, 2020. Yeah, that was what it said in the notes. That was during the pandemic, correct? Yeah. She started working more like... Okay. No, let's just keep it that way. Yep, that's right. She was learning how to wear her mask and that kind of stuff. I mean, Walgreens was open. Yeah. What month and year did she stop working at that job? May, 2020. That's why I'm so confused, because I think she was probably... I think she hadn't really ended yet, but she wasn't really attending because I was fearful about the pandemic. Then I think it was like, \"Okay, this is going on and on, the quarantine and plus we're not going to hire her.\" Yeah, she ended in May. Okay. Then Dollar General, do you remember what month she started working there? Yeah, July. When she stopped working at Dollar General? I just started buying Christmas stuff, so it was probably November. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about what she did at the Walgreens job? Stocking. Did she receive support while working at that job? Yes. The job coach, yeah okay. You said she had a job coach, right? Yep. Any other supports on the job? Nope. Okay. You said that was sort of... That the program ended essentially. . Do you think that will... The internship, yeah. Did you think that job was a good fit for her skills and interests? I did. Yeah. Why was that? Because she was happy, because she likes to sort, because I think she got over the initial anxiety of what a job was and the initial anxiety... I don't know if anxiety is the right word. Probably initial confusion of that type of a store, so she was having a hard time at first understanding, like you can't buy things right now because you're working. But after you work, you can then buy your drink and your snack. By the end of the three months, she had that down. I think it was too bad that then it didn't continue and she had to start that all up somewhere else. Yeah. What about the Dollar General sort? Did you think that was a good fit? Average, so-so. Why would you say just average? It was more cluttered. There wasn't as much physical space to move around for... She was doing the same job, stacking. But even I was claustrophobic as a customer in there, and so I could just see where the physical environment wasn't going to work as successfully for her as it was going to at Walgreens. What do you want to call it? The mat... Not the materials. The crap we buy, what's it called, the merchandise. The merchandise also changed a lot, and so there wasn't as much predictable routine at Dollar General, as there was at Walgreens. The job coach was the same and she was amazing. The management between Walgreens and Dollar General was significantly less reliable, so that also caused there to be... Nobody at Dollar General kind of... None of her fellow employees even understood who she was, where's at Walgreens, they were much more inclusive and supportive because they were used to vocational supported student or people coming in, and the manager was really good about including them. Nicole was the... In all fairness to Dollar General, the manager who left, she agreed to have Nicole, because she thought the whole idea was cool and they had never had any relationship with the vocational agency before, or never hired anyone with an intellectual disability. I mean again in all fairness, it was breaking ice and building... I don't know, what am I trying to say? It was the first time, where Walgreens had had a relationship with the vocational agency, and had many people go through. Right. Yeah, great. Then did Nicole volunteer in the community at all since the last time that we spoke? No, because of COVID. We definitely were going to have some volunteer opportunities and they all fell apart. Yeah, okay great. Almost to the end then. Any other overall notes about sort of what Nicole has been doing with her time? Any thoughts about those things? She's been really limited by the fact that she can't be out in public. She's a very social public girl. I think it's definitely limited possible job opportunities. We were going to explore her being a greeter, I think she was going to do some work, either volunteer or paid at a nurse home or senior center that wasn't going to happen because they were the most vulnerable population, and I think that'd be a great population and a great environment for her to work with. Yeah, she's been significantly impacted by this. Yeah. Okay, any other updates that you wanted to share with us? She is getting extended school year, should probably know that. I had to advocate for it, and I just found out they're only going to do it for the hours that she's that... If she can be stable enough to... Excuse me. Yeah, I'm being interviewed. You have to come down here please. Can you come down here please? Do you think we have just a couple more minutes, Molly? Yeah, like two more minutes. I've just  minutes, then I need to talk to you please. Yeah, I've got an appointment with the Apple Store. At what time? At 5:15. Hold on one sec, Molly. Sure. . Hi, sorry about that. That's okay, I'm actually- Okay, so... Catching up on other notes, so that's great. Okay. You were telling me about how you got her to have an extended school year, and only doing the hours she's able to. That was where we left off. Well, it wasn't only the hours she's able to and that's a bummer. I was hoping that they would have support did her for some social skills support, and some daily living stuff because, none of that was met this year. They just came back and said, no. They'll only support her the two days a week for two hours that she's scheduled to work at . It's good that I got extended school year, or that Nicole did. It's too bad that it's not enough and it's a preview to me that it's going to take a fight to get the districts to support the loss that a lot of these young adults have had, that aren't going to be made up because they're going to be exited from the school district, so- Yeah. ... getting ready for that battle. Absolutely, yeah. Before I let you go, I just have to verify your email and mailing address. I know we've been corresponding over emails, that's still the best email to reach you at? Yes, please. Have you changed mailing address? Nope. Great. If that covers everything you wanted to tell me, then we're all good to wrap up the interview and thanks for sitting down. Assist would not be possible without your participation in these interviews. No problem. It wouldn't be possible without all you guys working for it too, so thank you for that. Yeah, absolutely. Great, well have a good rest of your day. Thanks you too. Bye-bye Molly. Bye.\n",
            "finishMake sure I didn't miss anything. It'll tell me if I did. Okay, good. So this is the final section. Okay. So last time we spoke, we discussed some activities that Justin had been involved in. We would love to hear what he is doing now. Please describe Justin's high school situation. Is he still in high school or receiving services through the school system? He is officially graduated for all intents and purposes, but he is enrolled for the 18 to 21 program, which is still through the school. Is that right? Answer that. Yeah. Can you tell me... It's not high school, like it's a different... Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay, good. Sorry. Well, okay. Sorry, stuff's just falling off my desk, I guess. Oh, I have a feeling that your desk looks like the next to the couch next to me. You don't want to see. I have it here. It's probably best. What's that old thing? It's a sign of a creative mind. So. Did Justin's high school track or plans change since we last spoke? His high school track or plans change since we last spoke. You assume I know what we were doing then. So what would've been... I feel like yes, because he got so much more engaged and he's actually participating now. So, yes. Slightly. Yeah. How did that change his tracking plans? Just more... I'm super sorry. Okay. I just had to just check that text. It's just, it was uncertain if he would go on to do the 18 to 21, because he was just so disengaged. And now it's more, he's... God, my brain, I can't think of the right words. So it's changed in that we are certain that he will participate in the 18 to 21 program. Okay. And they're willing to do it virtually now, which they weren't before. So that opens it up for him. And lastly, because of COVID, the 18 to 21 program in our community was forced to individualize completely. And to be more flexible in things like how much time people were there. It wasn't just a group class where everybody did the same thing much of the time, so they had become more flexible and more, as they say their words, were individualizing things more. And our district saw greater progress in the participating students last year. So they are going to maintain that going forward. So that's made it, I'm actually excited to about it now because I think they're going to be able to be more accommodating of Justin. Yeah. That sounds awesome. Sorry. That was a long speech. No, that's great. Okay. When is Justin planning on exiting high school or this 18 to 21 program? The 18 to 21 program, so it will be May of... Oh my gosh, you're going to make me do Math. Okay. He'll be 20. May of 2023. Okay. Is Justin currently working? No. Why is Justin not currently working? Because he just doesn't have the interest. I guess that's the best answer, right? He's not interested yet. Okay. Has Justin worked and left any jobs since October 27th, 2020? No. Okay. Has Justin volunteered in the community during high school since last time we spoke? No. Okay. All right. Is there anything else you would like to tell us or any other updates you want to share? I don't think so. I pretty much feel like I made you hear everything. Thanks for listening. Yeah. Thank you. That was it. That was it. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today, assist  be possible without your participation. The last part here is I just want to reconfirm your email and your address. So can you tell me your email address? R-E-B-E-L-W-I-L-L@gmail.com. And my address is 474. Oh, I think you guys had that wrong. I think you had 475 and I never... I would always get it, but. So, but it's 474 . I thought... Okay. I know. I kept meaning to call like, oh yeah. Well now I can check that off my to-do list from last year. So 474 Basswood, B-A-S-S-W-O-O-D Ave in Verona. Wisconsin. 53593. 53593. Yep. All right, let me just make sure that this is all done. Didn't miss anything. All right. Perfect. That was the end of the interview. Thank you so much for- Thank you. Lovely to meet you. Thanks for- Yeah. Good to meet you. Being one of the good people in the world. Doing good things Seriously? That's so kind. All right, thanks. Thank you.\n",
            "finishAsk a little bit more about some of the activities that  has been involved in. So we would love to hear what he's doing right now. Some of the jobs that he's doing, we'll start by talking about his high school experience and sounds like he's no longer in high school, right? No. Yeah. He's 21. He graduated in 2000.  2018. He graduated. Also sounds like he's not receiving any services through the school system anymore, right? Right. Okay. Okay. All right. I know that he graduated 2018. Do you remember the month? It was 18 in June. It was June 2018. Okay. All right. Did he receive what type diploma did Peyton receive? He was... High school diploma. Right. So the regular kind? Yeah. Okay. All right. So can you tell me a little bit more about what does a typical week looks like for Peyton? He works his day job riding the bus Tuesday through Friday. So he is got a morning shift and an afternoon shift. Then he usually works Friday nights at the restaurant and usually one other night during the week, it sometimes like a Tuesday or he'll go in the evening and work there. Sometimes he'll work a weekend shift, but mostly his weekends are free. When he is not working, he's usually in his room playing video games. What type of video games does he like? He's really into smash brothers. Oh cool. I've heard of that. Okay. Before COVID he did a lot of competitions. He would go to tournaments all the time, all over the country too. He went to New York for a long weekend by himself. It freaked me out, but he did it. That's so impressive. For a competition in New York. And then he drives to Chicago a lot. He's gone to Minnesota. He's really upset because they are planning a big trip to Ohio that got canceled. Because there's no in-person tournaments right now. So he was all excited about a tournament in Ohio. I think one in North Carolina that he was planning on doing and both of those got canceled, but he travels all over the state of Wisconsin and even outside the state for these video game tournaments. Oh that sounds so fun. Since COVID, they've all been canceled because there's no in-person tournaments. So they've done you online ones, but they're not the same, I guess he's not spending a weekend hanging out with his and stuff. So. Yeah, those tournaments always have like a big screen. You get to sit with each other and you compete, I follow that world a little bit. So I like, I know the thrill of doing that. So he's really, really into it and he loves it. Oh, that's awesome. I hope that this tournaments will come back soon. Hopefully. Yeah. All right. So it sounds like he's doing some independent job. Is he attending any academic programs or volunteer jobs? Anything like that? No. Okay. All right. So I know that we talked about his schedule a little bit, but how many hours in total do you feel like he works every week. Probably about 20 a week right now for the bus driving. That's probably going to go up if the school starts picking up. Right now, I think he's working a little bit more now because all the kids are back. But they still don't have school on Monday, so he doesn't have that shift. So it might be 20 to 25 hours, bus. It's probably about 10 to 15 in his other job. He's probably working around 30, 35 hours a week. Oh cool. Between the two jobs. That's a great workload. It's not like too much, but it's... Yeah. And like I said, there's that gap in between. So it's not like eight hours straight. Like a grinding schedule. Yeah. He works from like 06:00 to 09:00 in the morning. And then he works again from like 01:00 to 03:00 in the afternoon or maybe 02:00 to 04:30 or so in the afternoon. So that means he got a downtime in between, so he still gets good hours, but without it being continuous. Okay. Yeah, that sounds great. Okay. So now I wanted to ask you some questions about the school programs that Peyton attended after high school. Did he ever attend any school programs after high school? Yeah. He went into Whitewater, UW Whitewater for a semester. He had a full load there. Okay. All right. Is he still enrolled? No. Okay. He actually was going for theater and he got the lead role in a play that was playing at the Bartell for, that was going to be rehearsing all second semester of his college. So he took that semester off to concentrate on the play and then he ended up not going back. Okay. And this was before COVID? Yeah. Okay.  Okayer. So since May last year, it sounds like he's... Sorry. I'm just trying to look at the forms and figuring out what I already know so that I don't ask you repeated questions. It's okay if you do. I'm available. Okay. So it sounds like since last may he's like just working independently, nothing else. Right? Right. And that's the Verona school district and yes. What's the name of the restaurant? Do you know? Headquarters. It's a bar and grill in Oregon. Okay. Headquarters sounds like a really serious name for a restaurant. It's a small sports family bar... Family restaurant. Okay. And he does some of the delivery jobs right now for the restaurant? He does some deliveries, but mostly he's either the dishwasher or food prep. Okay. Other than driving the bus for the school district, does he have any additional duties? Not at the school. Not for the  bus? No. Okay. And he's not receiving any support during these jobs. He's just doing this independently right? No. He's doing it. All right. And he's paid for this job. Can you tell me a little bit more about how did Peyton find both jobs? The job at Headquarters? I work part-time as a bartender there. So I got him the job there. As far as the bus driving job he just didn't know what he wanted to do. But he wanted something where he could work not with a lot of people around. He doesn't... And delivery driving is kind of what we were looking at maybe like Amazon or FedEx, but those all have really long hours and that would've just stressed him out. So I was just looking on Indeed and job sources looking for... He worked part-time for me at my law firm as the mail clerk, because our clerk was out during COVID for a little while. So he came in and filled in and he loved it, but it was only for a week. So I was looking for mail clerk jobs and I was looking for jobs like that online. So I was looking for delivery drivers and just drivers and things like that. And I found it and I'm like, \"I don't know if you're interested in driving a school bus, but Badger bus is hiring. They'll train you to drive a school bus.\" And he is like, \"I might be interested in that.\" So he checked it out and went through the CDL process, did all the training, got his CDL and he started working. So it just- That's amazing. We were just trying to find something where he could kind of work independently and wouldn't be that stressful and it's worked out so far. That's awesome. And it's the perfect job for not wanting to have a lot of people around it's like very- He got the little kids, but they're in the back and yeah... But he's independent. He does- Right, right. They don't really- Right now he's doing elementary school and middle school kids. Right. Right. And the kids have their own thing going on. So they probably don't really- Yeah. But it's a set routine too. And that's also something he really needs. It's here, \"this is the time you start, you drive this route, you come back.\" Which is why another of the reason why I thought delivery driving would be a good job for him too. Cause it'd be a very set routine. And so that helps him a lot too, because it is, it's a routine. It's very repetitive. Every time he goes in, he does the same thing. Which is very helpful. And for a bus driver, if you don't drive the same routine, you can get in trouble for that. So that's perfect. For a lot of people, routine is boring, but for him it's necessary. Yeah, absolutely. So he, he loves the repetitiveness of it. It's a perfect fit. You mentioned that he works about like 20 hours per week for the bus job. I think that's about what he's working right now is about 20 hours a week. That might go up next year when... Eventually it'll go up because they'll start going to school on Mondays too. Right now the school district isn't going to school on Mondays. And the longer you're there, the more shifts you can start getting and more routes you can get. So if it go as high as 30 at some point, but... Okay. Sounds great. And then I also think when sports start going, he can start volunteering to drive kids for extra hours he can drive kids, the teams to their sporting events, to other schools. Oh yeah, absolutely. Well, when the sports pick up again, that could be a thing too. Yeah. Yeah. He might be able to get extra hours doing that. So it could eventually lead to a full time 40 hours, but it would be again, he would drive like for half an hour and then he'd sit around for a few hours while they play and then drive back. So it wouldn't be as stressful even though he is working 40 hours a week. Oh, that's awesome. He gets to see what's going on outside, you know? So do you remember the month when Peyton started this activity, When did he start driving the school bus? What are we in now? April? He started training in November. I think he got his license and started actually working in January. It was either December or January. He actually started working. He trained for about a month and a half. He started training, I think in October or November. And then he had to do all the training before he could test for his actual get his CDL before he could actually have a route and drive on his own. So it depends. If you want to say, when did he start working for the company training? It was probably in October, but he didn't then actually start driving his own route until end of December, early January. Okay. Got it. It's a long training period too. I mean it makes sense. Okay. Any other thoughts about this job before we move on? Nope. I think that covered everything. Okay. Let's talk more about the restaurant job. So it's Headquarters bar and grill. And he's not receiving any job support for the restaurant job either, right? No. Nope. Okay. Okay. And he's paid? Yep. Correct? Yeah. Okay. Sorry. I'm just filling out the information that I already have. It's a very repetitive form. You're fine. Do you remember the date of month, month and year that Peyton started working at the restaurant? I want to say the summer of 2019. Okay. Would that be like July? August? June? Probably around July. Okay. I'm going to put in July 1st just for- Yeah. I don't know if that's exact or not, but that seems about right. Okay. Do you feel like this job is a good fit for Peyton? Yeah, it is. It doesn't pay a lot, but he really enjoys it. When he is dish washing, he just puts in his headphones, listens to podcasts and just does his job. And again, it's repetitive. And he likes the people there. He loves the people, they love him too. So even though he's got the job driving a bus, he still likes working there cause he really likes it.  That's awesome. You don't  get along with the people you work with. It's very good when you do. Any other comments about this restaurant job? No. Okay. And no other vocational activities, right? No. Okay. So I think that's all of the scripted questions that we have. Do you have any other questions for us or comments that we didn't cover? No. Okay. And before I let you go today, I wanted to verify your email and mailing address. Are those two unchanged? No, they haven't changed. Okay. All right. Well that's all of my questions. Really appreciate this meeting and loved hearing about the routine jobs. That's perfect. And thank you so much for putting your time into this project. We really needed more volunteers and it really- It's a good project. I like it. I'm glad I was notified of it. Okay, great. Well, I hope you enjoy the rest of the  project and thank you so much for being with me this afternoon. You're welcome. Thank you. Okay. Great. All right. Take care. Bye. Bye.\n",
            "finish... vocational history. I was listening in, but then I went off to make some more coffee, so I didn't get the full picture. So I'm just going to ask you some of the same questions, and I apologize for that. I'm sorry, Molly. Really quick, I'm just looking at my email. I did get this thing, but it was about a payment thing. I don't see anything about Connor. I just sent it. It might take a second. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. And I just realized I probably- I'll close it up and then look again - Okay. Sorry, go ahead. And I might have spelled his name wrong with a extra O, and I'm sorry. I just realized that I think I spelled it wrong. All good. Okay. Is Connor still in high school? No. No. He just completed ... I don't know what they call it, that after high school thing where . So he just completed it. He just aged out in April on his birthday. Got it. Okay. Was he in the transition program, something like that? Yes. Yeah. Transition program. Thank you. I can never think of what they called it. No, no, it's okay. It's called STEPs at his school, but I didn't know that that was the same at his school. In STEPs ... Or actually hold on. Has he ever worked at all during high school? Has he? Yes. No. Only volunteer. He's not done any paid work right now. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about where did he volunteer? Well, up until the pandemic, he worked at Loaves & Fishes in Naperville. Okay. On and off. Like I said, maybe - Yeah, and- ... he worked- Oh, go ahead. Mm-hmm . Oh, I apologize. Yeah. He had done it back when he was in middle school briefly. Then he wasn't really old enough to do it then, but he needed it for his confirmation hours or something. And then later, when he was old enough, he went back and ... You had to be 18. So he went back and he works just whenever we sign up, like when we have - Sure. And can you tell me what he was doing at Loaves & Fishes? Okay. Well, back when he was younger, he was doing food delivery to inbound seniors, which he really enjoyed that. He'd load up the truck with all the stuff and go to that facility. It would be like an apartment building and knock on the doors and he'd deliver to all those people or whatever, which is fun. He had to have an adult with him then, so we had to do it too. And then now that he's on his own I'm not there with him, so I can't give you real, super specifics, but he usually likes to work, it's called courtesy patrol, which is in the parking lot. So he helps load all the groceries. I guess the people can't park there, they have to park somewhere else and then they pull up with their car. Then he's one of the people that loads all their stuff into their car for them , so that's what he does. Okay, great. Yeah. All right. So was he in the transition program when COVID hit, then aged out while COVID was happening? Yes. Okay. Okay. Yep. Yeah. Because he aged out, I think, on their birthday, the 28th of April. They stopped school around 13th or something like that, March. Or yeah, his last month-and-a-half.  Okay. We had a big Zoom guy party thing for him, all the staff. Okay. So he's sort of in between right now, isn't he? Yes. Yes. But he's also been going to COD for the last ... This is his third year. Okay. Okay.  Ever since he finished actual high school his - Okay. ... year, he started going to COD, but he was also doing the STEPs Program. So he's still that doing that, although he is doing no classes this summer because everything's online this summer. His classes, it's hard to do just all online. He had to finish his last one online, but it's not great. He's in the auto program. So this fall he signed up for classes, but there's supposed to be hybrid where he does online for just the classroom part and then he has to come in for labs. But we'll see if that changes. But anyway, yeah. I don't know where going with all this. I'm so sorry. Well, I have questions, actually about the COD Program. So it's an auto program. He's been going there for three years you said? Yes, but, I mean, it's going very slow just because he was doing other programs at the same time. He's only been doing one class per semester because, for the first two years after high school, he did technical college DuPag, which is . But his teacher was awesome last semester. He was finishing up manual transmissions, or whatever, that was the class he was in. He would go into his garage and he'd be doing stuff and trying to show everybody in the class, which was really great. But it's not the same. No. That's what I mean. It was a good what he could do, just fill in, but he needed to actually be hands-on doing stuff in the class, so we'll see what's going to happen. I don't know. Okay. Before COVID, how many hours on an average week did he attend classes at COD? Oh, it was a total of maybe five just because, like I said, he only did one class. Sure, sure. Sure. It was two-and-a-half hours twice a week. Okay, so ... But we were hoping, like I said, to bump up to two or three classes this coming semester, but no. Great. And then, so one per ... That would be considered part-time. When did he start at the auto program? Can you remember the month and year that he started the COD auto program? At COD? I'm sorry, the classes at COD? Yeah. Let's see, he graduated in 2017, I believe May of 2017, so he would have started in the fall, which would be ... Well, if August 2017, I guess, was his first class. Okay. And did he get supports in those classes or does he get supports? No, he does not. Okay. Now, when he first started I was super-nervous because it's the first time I ever not had any contact. It's weird. I always had people at school that used to call me, a team, he always had a team- Right. ... and so it was like, \"Oh, my gosh. I'm sending him to a college class, but I can't be the weird mom going, 'My son ...'\" I didn't want to do that, so with my help and initiation he sent an email in his first class to his first teacher and just said, \"Hey, this is my first class. I'm just starting. This is my situation and here's how I am and here's how I'm best in the class, or whatever. If you could just check in with me.\" This kind of stuff. So he wrote this nice email and his teacher was so nice. He wrote back, he's like, \"Don't worry about a thing. You're going to do great. We're going to have a great semester.\" He was so awesome. So he knew, but Connor didn't have any accommodation. He did get an accommodations card. We did go into that office to get one. They give you this little blue card, or whatever, so that you can present it to any teachers or whatever. I guess there's a few things you can have, like extended time for certain things, or I guess you can get copies of notes from people or whatever. But he's never gotten any of those things as far as I know. I mean, maybe there's been a teacher who's let him take longer, I don't know  or something, but not that I'm aware of. But actually they're supposed to be able to go into a separate place to take a test if they want to separate on that. So yeah. So he only sent an email to the first guy and then other teachers he never said anything. I'm sure that after getting to know him they can probably get a sense that there's some stress there, whatever, or some things, whatever, but he's managed to take his classes and do very well. He's gotten all A's and B's there- That's great. ... and he's doing good. Yeah, but he loves auto stuff and this is his passion, so thankfully he does have something - Yeah. ... turn into something, I hope.  Is he working towards a certificate, a degree? How does that work? Well, there's two options at COD for auto, and one is a certificate. You just to complete the courses. You need to perform that type of job. And then the other is ... What's the other one? Not , but- Associate's? ... a two-year degree. Associate, yeah. Thank you. I didn't know what it was called. Associate's degree, but the only difference was Associate's you needed one English, one math, one science, one social studies, or something. He was just like, \"Oh my God, why do I need to?\" He's so disinterested in doing any of that. He's like, \"Nah, done all that.\" It will not help him in any way, shape or form for his job, honestly. I mean, I'm not saying those things aren't valuable. Obviously, they are. He's done them all his life up until then, but he was like, \"No. I don't need -\" Yeah, I think- ... again.\" He could always do it later. If he wants he can do ... It's a very, \"Okay, I'll do this - Okay. ... make any difference. - So he's probably going to go for the certificate. Well, because you don't really need the Associate's if you're going for a job. Yeah, I know. I did imagine him going for a job interview and then going, \"Oh, wait, you didn't do the Associate's and take the math class and the science.\" But they -\n",
            "finishHang on one moment. I asked him. Yeah. Got it? Okay. So this portion is related to vocational skills and you shared that Ian is still in high school. Right. Is he currently working at all? No. And what would that reason be for employment? Well, Ian is very passionate about computer, but anything we've tried to establish a routine, especially during COVID at home, because he doesn't participate in any chores or... he's low tone. He was labor low tone. So he's got problem with the hand grip, problem staying on his feet for too long. So whatever I try to engage Ian into, like taking the garbage out or, as of now, raking the leaves, it seems that he can never stay on task for more than 30 seconds. He's laying on the floor like he's dead tired like he ran a marathon. So it's very challenging into have Ian to get anything done. I know you shared that he's currently not working. Was he working and left any job in the last six months? He has never worked a day in his life. Okay. Does he do any volunteering in the community or added anything? He does not. I wish he could. He does not. Okay. And then for the last portion that we have, during the first visit, you worked with the team to set up three annual goals for you and Ian. And the purpose of these were to support families in helping their young adult pursue their dreams for the future and really start working on these goals. It's been about a year since that past and then we would like to know how he is doing with these goals. Before we continue and discuss again, I feel it's important to note that again with COVID and again so many life changes, I understand that there may have been additional barriers that imposed working on those goals. Right. The first goal was, with verbal prompts from family members, Ian would put away groceries at home to...\n",
            "finishAsk you about academic programs and employment that she's attended after high school. So- Okay. ...To get an idea of how she kind of spends her time, can you sort of tell me about the activities she participates in during a typical week? That's includes school, I mean, before COVID, school, jobs, can you just kind of talk about her typical week? Yeah, I mean, so I would either take her to the bus or she would walk to the bus and then she would take the bus from Westmont to College of DuPag. And if she got there early, she had worked with her counselor on building study time into her schedule between classes, time for lunch, and then she'd take the bus home. And she would either then walk home from the bus stop or I'd go pick her up. She likes to just kind of lay down, listen to music. I think she listened to music a lot on public transit or watch videos or whatever. And when she got home, it was like she needed downtime. And then we would have dinner, do chores. And then after dinner, she would usually do homework with prompting. And then during the school year, she was working Saturday morning from 6:30 AM to 11 or 11:30, and then Sunday from like 2:00 to 6:30. But again, that really hasn't happened since COVID. The summer after high school, she was working about 20 hours a week part-time. Okay. And then how many days a week... I'm going to ask you more specifically about those, but just real quick, how many days a week did she go to College of DuPag? Five. Okay. Okay, Great. Okay. And she started there last summer. She did take one class there last summer. Great. Okay. So if you could help me do the math, how many total hours do you think during an average week does she spend participating in all of the job and school activities? So it's five days a week for school. About how many hours is she at College of DuPag on a typical day? I would say she's gone between six and eight hours. Well, let's see. I would say she's gone between six to eight hours a day, Monday through Friday, and then figure eight to 10 hours on the weekends working. Okay. So I'm going to do an average 50 hours. That's on the more generous side. Okay, great. Okay. So we're going to first talk about College of DuPag. Is there a certain name of the specific program that she's in? No, she's in General Studies. Okay. And she's aligned. Her counselor is the counselor for students with special needs, and he leads up the Autism America program. Although she does not like to go to that typically because of the noise. So her suggestion to him was... We had a phone call with him about a month ago on her planning for her schedule for next year, and he asked her why don't you like to come? It's too noisy. Well, what if I had a room for people who needed quiet? And she's like, oh yeah, that sounds like a good idea. You know, it's just the noise factor, I guess. And then can you tell me a little bit about sort of the type of... What am I trying to say? Like it's a general studies degree then certificate. Is it a specific certificate in a specific area? No, it's basically taking basic college requirements. Okay. Until she decides what she wants to major in and transfer to a four year institution. Got it, got it. She would earn a Bachelor's Degree, which she has no idea what she wants to do, so. Okay. Yes. Great. Thank you. And how many hours would you say she spends studying outside the classroom? Not enough. I guess, 16 to 20 a week. No, it's probably more than that, because I'm thinking of when she's home, but maybe during school she's studying maybe an hour and a half, two hours a day. I don't know. It's hard for me to kind of judge, because I don't know how she's really using your time between classes. I know what the schedule suggests she should do that she has with her counselor, but I don't know if she actually does it. Okay. Okay. Let's see. And what's the average number of classes that she takes per semester? Well, first semester she took four and didn't pass one. It was the English class. Second semester she was in four and dropped one, but she came up with the plan for dropping, which was a good choice. Okay. It was good that she made a decision versus no decision at all, yielded a very poor grade. And it was too many classes with too much writing for her particular challenge. And she made the decision to drop the class? She did and I agreed with her decision. Great. Yeah, I was supportive of that decision and was not emotional, did not overreact. Like wow, I'm pleased that you thought about what your options were and you came to a conclusion. And can you tell me when the month and year she started at the College of DuPag program? June of, let's see, so 2019, I guess. Wait, June of 2019, would that have been right? Yeah. Yeah. June of 2019. Okay. Bout a year ago. And does she receive supports from the program? I know you said her counselor is part of this sort of supportive program that's built in, but does she get any other kind? No, it's not built in, really. She doesn't take advantage of the support that's available to her, because I don't think she takes advantage of it. Okay. Because it's too difficult to go talk to a human being. Okay. Okay. Okay. Great. And are there any other schools or programs that she's attended after high school? No. Okay, great. And then employment. So can you tell me the actual name of the doggy daycare where she works? Doggy Depot. And actually I think she started there two years ago. So two years ago she was working 20 hours a week in the summer. Yeah. So that's right. So she's worked there two years, two or three years. I can't remember. So would that be June of 2018? That sounds right. Yeah, that sounds about right. Great. And can you tell me a little bit about... You already said some of the things that she does at this business. And can you tell me a little bit, like does she receive supports on the job? No. No, I don't think so. No. So when... I mean, I know the people who own this business from a business perspective because we took our dog there. And so when I was asking them about employment for my daughter, I explained the situation, that she has some challenges and they actually hire people with special needs through Downers Grove North and Downers Grove South. I was unaware of that at the time. Oh, okay. So they're aware, yet I think kind of a point of frustration, like sometimes when she doesn't respond to emails, they know me, Hey, I hate to reach out to mom, but can you help us? We need help this afternoon. Can Shia come work for a couple hours? Okay. So she's not... And like they had a big post Christmas party and they got prizes and they took everybody bowling, but she didn't sign up for it. Okay. And they probably didn't remind... I think that they probably get tired of reminding her about stuff. Okay. I know like even around the COVID scheduling, like, oh, I'm not getting scheduled. Like, well how many emails do you have that you haven't responded to? Oops. You know? And then. Yeah. Okay. But I think it's a generational thing. It's a generational thing, I think, a lot of it with email. These kids just, it's just- Yeah. ...They'd rather text, right? Yeah. And God forbid, if you ask them to pick up the phone and make a phone call. I mean- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. At least mine. Mine just turned 15 this week. She does not want to. She's so uncomfortable with the phone. It's interesting how much things have changed. Yeah. Okay. So you mentioned... Just I want to make sure I get all the information, that she cleans the dog cages, that she has to mop out and sweeps and mops the floors I think you said. Yeah. And vacuums, washes the dog bowls. Okay. Cleans the common areas probably. Okay. Thanks. Okay. But she does not work directly with the dogs? She does not want to. Nope. Okay, great. Thank you. And is she paid for this job? She is. Okay. And before COVID I guess I'm going to say, about how many hours a week did she have this job? You said that summer it was 20 hours a week. On average- Yeah. I mean during the school year, I think it ranged between four to nine. I mean, it was just hard with taking a bus to and from. And we really thought she should... I gave her the option if she wanted to keep working or if she wanted to quit. She did say that she wanted to keep working. Okay. So, like usually two shifts a week, Saturday and Sunday, so maybe nine to 10 hours a week. Okay, great. Just make sure I write that in. Okay. And great. Do you have any other comments about this job or any circumstance or anything you want to add about her experience? No. No? Okay. No. I mean, she's already gotten a raise. I think when she got the raise, then she realized... It was like a dollar an hour or 75 cent an hour raise. And then she realized, oh no, I don't want to quit. And they did ask her did she want to interact with the dogs and make more money an hour, and she chose not to because it would require people interaction. Okay. Okay. And hold on, I can't type as fast as you talk, but  I'm pretty fast, but not. So you need to be using Google voice? Yes. Or you know the translation services available through WebEx, and it will all be typed for you. There you go. It's funny. So right. That is a service... Each university, so because we have three universities in this program, Madison uses WebEx. It's all about what platform the university approves. Yeah. Whereas U of I, we can do this and we do Zoom and then Vanderbilt, same thing. But- Yeah. And I work for Cisco, which also WebEx product, which is actually more secure. And a lot of the federal agencies use WebEx for that same reason. Yeah. And I've heard from the group that Madison is the most concerned about security. So it doesn't surprise me that they have WebEx. I was actually surprised that the one that we are recommended to use is Zoom. But I just follow what university tells me to do. That's right. That's all you can do. My brother, I think, used to work for Cisco. Oh, okay. Yeah. Long time ago. Okay. So any other part... She participated in any other employment or vocational or volunteering activities since leaving high school? Nope. Okay, great. When Janice gets on the phone, she will ask her about some of these jobs. She'll ask her some of the same questions just about if she feels like it's a good fit for her, her job so. Okay. We'll get Shia's point of view as well. Okay. Fantastic. Okay. We have one more to go, and that's our service access. I just need to find it here on my computer. Here we go. Nope. Where is it? Here we go. Okay. So for this one.\n",
            "finishIt's about... Let me pull the page. It's about her high school. Mm-hmm . She's not in high school and then she graduate on May, am I correct? Correct. Can you tell me what does a typical week look like for Shaya? How has she been spending her time? Okay, so this semester, she goes to campus at College Of DuPag on Monday and Tuesday. So I usually take her to the bus stop and she takes the bus to College of DuPag and then comes home on the bus. And sometimes I pick her up from the bus or sometimes she walks home. Wednesday and Thursday she has remote class. Friday she has no classes. So recently she has been doing a team project for her marketing class so she's staying at college longer in the day or last night they had a study group so I took her to community college because the bus stopped running at a certain point. And I just did my own work in the library until she was done and I brought her home. My daughter will grocery shop with either her sister or me every week. She'll throw laundry in, fold clothes if I ask. She's a very, very good cook. She will clean up the kitchen. She will take care of the cats and the dog, but she will clean her room but most of it has to be prompted by me, I guess I would say. Yeah, well she's doing wonderful. Yes. Yeah, yeah. But she's an outstanding cook. She's very helpful around the house. She helps with the yard and gardening. She sometimes helps a neighbor with her yard. So when she is asked, she does an outstanding job. Wow. That's wonderful. So let me see. So I was saying now she's involved in postsecondary education progress. Mm-hmm . Yeah. And how many total hours during the average week, does she spend participate in all this vocational and educational activities? Oh, that's a good question. Does that include studying? Yes, because that is educational activity. Okay. So, oh let's see. Actually, let's maybe not including studying because studying may be different day to days, right? Or week to week. Yeah, I guess maybe 10 hours a week. I don't know. I think it depends on the week. So again, recently she's been involved in this project, so they've been meeting once or twice a week to have a group project. I don't know. I guess 10 to 12 hours maybe. I don't know. And also she's going to school four days a week, right? Four days a week, yes. She has no class meets on Friday. Yeah. So that 10 hours is including she go to school four days a week? Yes. Or extra. Okay. It doesn't include study time though. Okay. Is she currently enrolled or has she been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school community college? Community college, yes. Yes, she's doing now. She's at community college. Yes. So you said she's in the College of DuPag, right? DuPag, correct. Yeah. Can you tell me a little bit more about this program? Well, I mean, it's not a specific pro... She's completing basic requirements for an undergraduate education that hopefully will transfer to a four year bachelor's degree. You said she's still not decide what is her major, right. But she's interesting in market? Marketing, finance, accounting, correct. Is this an autism disability specific program? No, it is not. This is a two year college associate degrees? You know I don't think she's even going to get an associate's degree. I don't know. Yeah, I should find that out. Okay. So what is she area of study? Yeah, we just talking about. Yeah. So just general requirements. This semester, she also has a biology class and lab. She took last year and her last semester, wait, no, I think it was the summer. I don't remember. Maybe it was last spring, an art appreciation class as part of a humanity's requirement. So yes, she's kind of getting the basic. This summer she took a speech class. So she's getting kind of the prerequisites, I guess. Taken care of, completing those. But it's kind of, who knows how many of those are going to transfer because we don't know what her academic plan of studies going to be. Right. So what is the average number of classes she is taking per semester? It's down to three now. She had taken more and she failed a couple classes. So three seems to be the right number for her. Is she a full-time or part-time student? I don't know. I don't know if it's considered full or part-time. I don't really know. That might be a question for her. Do you remember the month and year she start this program? She started... Okay so she graduated from high school in May. August. You know what? I think she took a class in June. I think she started then with one class in the summer. Is she receiving support from the program? No. They do have services available but she has determined that she does not want to take advantage of them through College of DuPag. Hmm. So do you feel this program is a good fit for her? I don't know. I mean I guess so she can get there on the bus. She doesn't have a driver's license. It's given her a good background in general studies. But I don't know. But nothing has... I don't think prepared her for the next step. So how is she going to figure out where she's going to transfer to because she insists on living at home and what her degree is going to be. And she is capable of that from an academic perspective, but perhaps not from a feeling of confidence and secure from a social standpoint, I guess. So yes, she could walk a block from our home, get on the train and get to university of Illinois, Chicago. But again, we don't know what that plan of study is going to be. Yeah. That's difficult. Mm-hmm . If you have additional comments about this academic program or do you have any comment to let us know? No, I mean I just like we're at a crossroads. Okay, what next, right? Yes. So you her academic advisor at the College of DuPag works with special needs students, but I mean he's not even really making suggestions on, have you considered this or none of that. And that vocational testing piece is missing. And somebody helping her decide, okay I think it was called, I don't know, whatever interest inventories art have been used. I guess we haven't looked at the one she did in high school for some time. I don't know if we still have it but she was very high in science and analytical skills. She was in the girls who code program. She took a coding class. I understand she did quite well. So but again, as a parent, she's not as likely to listen to me. I work for a fortune 50 technology company as an example. And I know that there are programs to get women involved in cybersecurity and because of her analytical skills, I think she'd be phenomenal. I had a discussion with her last week. Well, you have an interest in finance and accounting. Wow. You could marry that with cyber security and create some very good opportunities for yourself. Yes. But again, I don't think there's been that initiative that she's exploring that. Yeah. Maybe take some time, right? Yeah. Is Shaya currently enrolled in another school program? No, just through College of DuPag, that's it. Is she currently participate in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities? No. I've encouraged that but we talked about her volunteering at a local humane society. She said the form was too long. I had been involved in a focus group with our library and they have created a new diversity, equity and inclusion policy. And there are a number of job openings at the public library as an example for to shelve books, which I did at the urban free library. It was my first job. Okay. And I suggested to her that might be a good opportunity knowing that they took the girls who code class there and because of their new emphasis on diversity equity inclusion. I think she could use her disability to her advantage but her comment was she didn't want to apply for a job until she gets her license. Well, she's now on her... Okay. Yeah. I mean, she could walk there but whatever. That would be a good fit for her. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So now...\n",
            "finishOkay. Let me go back one part. This is post-high school. For this section, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that Connor has done since May 20th, the last time you spoke to somebody on our team. So first I'd love to ask how Connor usually spends his time. So we'll talk about activities that he participates in during a typical week. So what does a typical week look like for Connor and how has he been spending his time? Well, currently he works on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, one to five. And he goes to class on Monday and Wednesday at College of DuPag, one to 3:30. He's in one class. And other than that, not a whole lot. Hanging out with us, doing whatever we needed to do. I don't know. Not a whole lot, not a lot of socializing at these times. It's been hard. Absolutely. But a little bit more now, since things were getting . I hate to say they're better, but they're not better. I don't know. You know what I mean. We've had moments of where we've actually been able to see people and do a few things, but still not back to normal. Not that he'd be out partying or something, but he's had a few little get-together things, but that's about it. Nothing much. So school and work. That's a lot of different responsibilities and managing all of that during the week. Yeah. Okay. So I'm going to ask if he's currently involved in some of these different things. So is he involved, it sounds like a post-secondary education program at DuPag? Yes. COD. College of DuPag. Does he participate in any type of vocational training program or internship? You did not mention that. So that would be no. Vocational training? No. Does he work independently or for pay with support? He works independently for pay. How many total hours during the average week, does Connor spend participating in all of these different... well, the school and employment piece that you mentioned? Okay. 12 plus six is... 18 hours. Obviously, it doesn't include homework and stuff, but those are the hours that you've actually in class or working. Does he do any volunteering in the community? No, he's not gone back since COVID started. He used to work at Loaves & Fishes, but hopefully he'll go back to that maybe next summer. Okay. So the next question is talking through school programs that Connor had attended since high school. So again, thinking back to May 20th. Wait, when? May 20th This is the last time we talked? Yes. Correct. Okay. Is Connor currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program community college, college, or university since May 20th? Yes. Could you tell me a little bit about the class that he's taking or his program at the College of DuPag? Sure. He is in the automotive technician program for automotive technology. And he is currently in a class for automatic transmissions. It's different every time. Right now, it's automatic transmissions. And you shared earlier, it will is one to 3:30. So he  six hours of school in a week? Maybe I rounded up. Maybe it should have been five hours, sorry. Yeah. I feel like he always comes out of their late, so it feels like three hours each time, but it's really two and a half. So  18 hours depending on how long he stays in there because they do labs all the time and he stayed after. Okay. Is this an autism or disability specific program? No. Give me one moment. Is he working towards an associate's degree at this time or planning to transfer? They have two ways of doing it, associate's degree and then just a certificate. He could still do an associates if he really wanted to, but I don't think he wants to. I think he just wants to do a certificate because the associates, all it is, you add in a reading, math, science and social studies class. So he's like, \"Ugh.\" I don't think it's going to help him get a job. So he already had pretty intense with high school, all that stuff. So I'm thinking it's just going to be a certificate, but it's still open-ended because he's only got a few more classes left, but we'll see. I know you shared automotive technician program and courses. Could you think of any other classes that he's taken outside of the automatic transmissions? In that program?  taken so many. Give me a half a second. I'll be right back. Okay. Great. Sorry. A half a second was ambitious, but okay. I have his little transcript. It was on my desk because I was doing something with it  rather than trying remembering just tell you. So he has taken Intro to Automotive, you have to do at the beginning. Automotive Basic Electricity, that's Electricity I. Engine Design and Operation, Suspension, Steering and Alignment, Automotive Air Conditioning and Heating, Automotive Engine Electricity, that's the second level. Manual Drive Train and Axles, Engine Controls & Emissions first level, Braking Systems, Advanced Chassis Systems, and now he's in Automatic Transmission. Could you share with me what that total number has been so far? Classes? 1, 2, 3... He's in his 12th class. And how many classes does he typically take in a semester? Well, he's mostly done one. He did have a semester to where he did two, but prior to this year he was also in a whole other program. So he did two full years at Technology Center of the DuPag and he did a year of their auto-tech program and a year of their auto-body. So he was juggling both. And then he was doing his post-secondary stuff and that was taken up time. And it's been a very slow process. But like I said, he usually has something else. And now he's just doing one because he is got a job. So I thought we'd start doing like, \"Let's start doing two or three at a time\", but with everything else, it's just... I don't know. Sounds like he has a lot of experience. He's doing a lot right now and he has great and ambitious goals. Is he considered part-time then with the one course he's in? Oh, we'd assume so. I can't imagine that's full time. But I get it. His GPA is pretty good. He got a 3.545. Look at that. That's great. Great. Very proud. Absolutely. Do you remember the month and year that he started this program? If it's on here. It is not. So that was Fall August or September, whenever they start. It's been a while. Is he receiving supports in all from the program? Well, what's really nice about COD is... I don't know if you're familiar with the school. Okay. Well anyway, they have a very good support department or whatever you want to call it. I don't know. So he's all signed up for if he needs it, he's got a card he can use, he can tell us to, but he's never used any of it. He can do extended time on tests or he could do different types of things or someone writes notes for him. Those are some of the things they offer as part of having a disability, but he's never used any of it. But it is there if he need it and I'm sure some people do. That's a great program. For a second. I thought you were talking and nothing was coming out. So I was like \"Uh oh.\" Oh no. That's Okay. I just want to make sure I didn't lose the audio too. I was like, \"Oh great.\" So anyway. Do you feel that this program is a good fit? He's obsessed with cars. He has been since day one. So this is his niche. Back to you saying, when he is done with this, you might want to go do another program in autobody and another school. So I'm like, \"Okay.\" Just  forever in college. I don't know. We'll see. I think pretty awesome and exciting that he's found something that he is so passionate about and there are programs out there that he can continue you to . It's good that he has a thing for something that can actually become a career. Absolutely. Do you have any additional comments about the academic program? No. So far it's been good. He's had a good experience. I'll have to see how it finishes. I have no idea how much help they'll be in helping him. How hard it'll be for him to find employment in this specific area. I worry about that, definitely. He's got the knowledge. It's just whether... I don't know. I don't see him working at a dealership where you have to be real really quick. He's not a quick person. He wants to restore cars. That's what he wants to do, which is a very slow and meticulous and whatever kind of job. Most people when they first start, unless they maybe go work in a dealership and I'm like, \"Oh, I can't picture that.\" So we'll see. But as far as class is good. Great. And is he currently enrolled in any other school program at this time? Not right now. No. Now we're going to talk about, I really do appreciate your time today and taking time to answer these questions. Can you tell me about the jobs or programs beginning with the current or most recent job and working back to the last time you spoke to somebody on the team in May? Is he currently employed? You said yes. Yes. And you share that he is working for pay independently? Yes. Could I ask the name of the company agency or business? Sure. It's NAPA Auto Parts. Could you describe what he does at this business? Sure. He works in their distribution warehouse. I don't know what his title is, but doing stock stuff. So basically he has a pallet of materials and he has to take them off and scan them and find their location and put them in their proper places and stuff like that. So nothing too hard. You really do have to have a good knowledge and skillset though. There are so many different auto parts to be able to know and navigate. I think that it's . That's funny. A lot of people that work that don't really know much about that stuff, because they're like, \"Oh, God. Connor tells us everything about cars.\" So Connor knows about all of them, but I don't think that you have to have a working knowledge of the parts to the job, but he does, which makes it an interest level for him, which is why that was the job they thought, \"Oh, he might like this for or first job.\" So I was like, \"Yep. Sounds good.\" Absolutely. And you shared that he does not currently receive support when participating? No. When he first got there, his job coach person through the program he was in, went. And so like he got it immediately, it was not hard for him. And then she went another day or two and she's like, \"I don't need to be there.\" She stopped in like a couple of times in the last several months. Just maybe if that, because that's part of her job to do that. He does a person that he works with pretty regularly, they're buddies. So they work together, which is nice, but it's not like he's his coach or anything. Is it a coworker? Coworker. A nice one who will listen to him talk about car. Maybe he's got a hearing aid. He just turns it down. I don't know. I'm kidding. He just smiles a lot. And you shared that he's paid for this, correct? Yes, he is. Okay. And how many hours per week does he work? 12, three days, four hours each time. He probably could do more now. When we first started, I was \"Ah\", because he had only had one other little, very tiny job that was once a week for three hours. And they were like, \"Oh, this job is Monday through Friday.\" It was eight or nine hours. I was like, \"Ah, I don't think he can do that\", especially because he is a student. And so we're like, \"Let's start with just 12.\" He's been fine with it. Great. Do you remember the month and year that Connor started this job? March. Okay. And do you feel that it's a good fit for Connor skills and interest? Interest? Yes. Skill? It's fine. It's not hard for him. I'm hoping that's not what he would have to do forever, but if he did, he enjoys it, but I think he's got a much broader skillset with the car knowledge where he could be using that with more, but at the very least, in the store, helping people. I don't know if the store would be the best one, but I don't know, anyway. I don't know what I'm say. I'm just rambling. It's a good fit for now. How about that? Great. Do you have any additional comments about this employment or any circumstances you would like to explain or elaborate on? No, I don't think so. It's been a good experience for him. And the only thing I don't is now when we want to go somewhere, I have to like, \"Oh, I have to figure out Connor. He's got work.\" Not used to that. So other than that, it's great. Asking for vacation and time off. I know. It's like, \"Oh shoot.\" We have to put in a time thing for him to get out days off. So anyway, just something to remember. Yes, absolutely. And is he involved in any other type of employment, vocational or volunteering activities? No. Okay.\n",
            "finishAll right, there we go. we are going over the... Let me see. Vocational Index. So I'm going to place this right here, okay? All right. Okay so going back to DuPag. Okay so you met new people there, taught you a lot of things, and you would get feedback from other individuals. Based on how my work is. If there's something that they don't like and suggest some changes, then I would do it. But yeah, I've met a lot of cool people at college. Awesome. And what was your reason for leaving the program? Did you graduate or complete it? Leaving college of DuPag? Yeah. Well, I'm just leaving because I'm finishing up getting my Associate's degree. Okay, so is it appropriate to say that you graduated or completed? Mm-hmm , I think it's appropriate, yeah. It sounds like it's like \"I don't like College of DuPag, I'm going to leave\" but nah. So I can say he is completing his Associate's. Awesome, do you have any additional comments to say about it? About college? About DuPag? Yeah College of DuPag. I mean, it's a fun experience to meet friends and walk around the campus since it's like a community college. One of the things that I like is the gaming lounge. They have a gaming lounge and I get to play video games with people because yeah, we always love to play video games. I mean, I even hang out with them sometimes outside of college, like they would have a party for a certain game and I would be there. So yeah there's a lot of socializing when I'm there. Awesome. The next one is the Steps program that you did. Oh yeah. Do you think that was a good fit? No. Wasn't. Why not? Well, when I went there, I'm not being hypocritical or anything, but they didn't have the right level that would match up with my level. There were a lot of people that were kind of lower-functioning and they kind of treated them differently, like probably as, I guess, kids or something like that, and there were some of the skills that they would try to teach us that I think I would already know. And I felt like it was just a waste of time, but also I sometimes feel like that I'm just not a right fit it because I'm not in those levels, like I already know how to do math, I'm driving, I already have a job. There's literally no point. And at Steps, like if class was over you would probably think that like, \"Hey, so I'm an adult I can hang out in the hallways\" but nah, they kind of guard you in that room, not letting you out until the next class starts. So yeah, I just don't like that. And I also felt uncomfortable when they have to have us keep our backpacks in the hallway on a hook. And I have a fear that what if somebody goes into my backpack and steals my things? That's just another thing, it's just their system around here just doesn't fit very well with me. And ever since they switched from the program in their own building into a freshman building at Neuqua Valley, that's when I'm like, \"This is crossing the line, I got to go. I don't want to be in a building where there's like minors everywhere.\" Because sometimes people in the Steps program, they could probably like get the hots for younger kids or something like that let's just say. So I just don't want to deal with that situation since we're adults. I just didn't think it was very appropriate for me. So I dropped out. Yeah. So you've chose to leave the program? Yep. Okay. Not only that I didn't feel like myself there but also because they moved the program into a freshman building. And I just don't feel comfortable being in a high school building for Steps. That was the bad choice that they ever done and they're still at the Neuqua Valley freshman building. Got it. I mean the only good thing about this place was they allowed me to drive on my own to get there, but they would have buses to pick up people and it was like the little yellow bus basically and I just don't want my neighbors to see me going into that bus because I don't want to be classified as one of those kinds of levels, I want to be normal. I'd just rather be treated normal instead of being treated like a kid. That's my only complaint about Steps. Yeah, okay. The next program your mom talked about was the Microsoft Excel program that you did for eight weeks. Oh yeah. Do you feel like that program was a good fit? I mean, it was at some point, but I already knew what I was doing and I would always get the work done quickly and the rest of the students are older people, elderlies. Yeah. That's what your mom was saying. And I'm just like, \"you kidding me?\" So while the instructor was instructing how to do this and that, I already went up ahead and then after I'm done, I just sit there and wait and wait and wait until class is over. Good. So did you finish the program? Mm-hmm . Completed it? Okay good. Awesome. And the last one your mom talked about was working at Meijer. You're currently working there. Do you feel like that program or job is a good fit? It is as of now, but sooner or later I would like to have like a full-time job, but for a graphic designer, I don't want to work in a marketing place throughout my whole life.  Where? For graphic designing, mm-hmm . Awesome. And you're currently still there, right? Yeah. I'm still at Meijer's right now. Perfect. Is there anything else you'd like to say about it, about the job or program? I mean the company's really good. I suggest shopping there all the time because we're always nice to the customers around us. And good payment and they also understand like some of the struggles and stuff like that so they're more open, so that's what I like about it. Awesome, we are done with that section, so I'm to go ahead and stop this.\n",
            "finishI spoke with your mom and she told me that you are working at Kroger. Yes. So I just have a few questions about how your job is going. Let me open that up here. Do you feel that this job is a good fit for you? Yeah. And why? Because, there are people like me there. And what do you mean when you say people like me? Like young people? That, and- Mm-hmm . ... I guess that's it. Okay. Is there anything else that you like about your job or anything that you don't like that you would like to tell me about? Well, the bosses are nice. There's nothing I really don't like about it. That's awesome. You're lucky. And then your mom also told me that before you were going to National State. Yes. And you were studying culinary arts? Yeah. Do you feel that program was a good fit for you? Kind of, yeah. And why do you feel it was a good fit? I love baking. Is there anything that you wish would've been different? Not that I could think of. And what was the reason for leaving that program? I guess college wasn't a good fit for me. And can you tell me a little bit more? So what happened? Why wasn't it a good fit for you? I was fine with culinary but the other class is not so nice. And do you have anything else that happened there that you enjoyed or did not enjoy? I don't. Okay, great. Thank you so much, . So I'm going to stop the recorder.\n",
            "finish... about his week and what he's doing during the week. And then I have a second survey for you to complete. Okay. Do you need to use a restroom? Mm-mm  No. Let's see. Okay. Has he ever worked during high school? He didn't work during high school. And did he volunteer in the community during high school? No. No. Just to get it generally, what does a typical week look like for him? Or how is he spending his time? He works three to five days a week. And in his free time, he spends it doing what he likes. He usually play video games, watching TV, reading. Okay. So he's working three to five days, on average how many hours do you think? Or it depends on the week? Usually 48 hours a day, like last night he worked four hours on Sunday, I think he works six, on Saturday he may have worked eight, so it just varies. So he doesn't have a-  Schedule. ... number of hours that he- No. So they assign him to whatever is available. Not more than 30 or? Right. He usually works 20 to 30 hours a week. Okay. And is he taking any classes? No. He went to Nashville state for one year. Okay. So I'll ask you all that in a moment. And I'll ask you more questions of what he was doing there. So after graduating high school, was that the only postsecondary program that he attended or did he- Mm-mm  Okay. So that was natural state. Can you tell me a little bit about the program or what course he was taking? He went for culinary arts and so he took about 12 classes a week and then he worked also. Wow. When he was in school, he only worked about 15 to 20 hours a week. So he works more now, because he is not in school. Yeah. Did he graduate from that? He didn't meet the requirements to go back, because he had to take classes like english and math. And I wish we had went to a technical school. Yeah. Yeah. Instead of a junior college. I think a technical school would've fit in better. Mm-hmm  Was that a two-year program? It was a two-year program, because he had failed so many classes, he couldn't go back for the second year. He wanted to but he couldn't. And at the end, if he completed that program, was he getting a-  Yeah. He wanted to be a baker. Yes. And you said he was taking 12 hours- 12 hours a week. So three or four courses? Yes. And that was full time for that program? Yes. Do you remember the year and month when he started? Mm-hmm  He started August of 18th. Okay. And his last month was may of 19. Okay. And so he left because he couldn't- He couldn't go back. Yeah, he wanted to go back, but he couldn't. Did he have any supports? Was he getting any supports when doing that program? Like having a tutor or more time for that excel? I believe they had tutoring at his school. I think he did go to some of those. But was that something specifically for him or any student? It's for any student? So no specific support for him?  No. And why not? Because I didn't know it was available. I didn't know how to- But do you think he would've needed any supports or- You know what? Looking back on it now, I just don't think a junior college was the right fit for him. I wish that we had gone to a technical school. Or he could have just learned to trade. Yeah. So I just think that it was just the wrong fit for him. He didn't like his English classes, he didn't like writing papers. He didn't like the courses, like the math courses. I think if he was just learning a trait, I think that would've been better for him. Yeah. And He didn't try or attended any other post-secondary program after that one or before that one? No. And then after high school, how many jobs did he have since- This is just his first and only job. Okay. So I'll ask you about this one and he's working at Kroger. So what is he doing there? He buy groceries. He says that he is responsible for putting items back and the baggage cards, he handles those. Yes. And he's paid for this job, does he get any type of supports in Kroger? No. They do have other people on the spectrum there. And so he likes his job and he likes the people that he works for, but as far as support now there's no extra support. And you said on hours, he's working 20 to 30 hours? Mm-hmm . How did he find his job? We just went online and applied for jobs in the area. And do you remember when he started his job? It was September of 18. Okay. Great. So that's The last question about employment. And this one is shorter. Sorry, I just say that so to know when to listen. But this is about services that he may or may not be hearing. And I'm just going to go through a list of  services that are available. Some people don't know all of them. And to be honest, I've learned out a few of them. So if there's something you don't know, just let me know. And in that case, I know you're probably not getting it or he's not getting it. And for any service that he's not getting, I'm going to ask you if he currently need it: so if you think he currently would need that service. Okay. But is he getting Supplemental Security Income? No. No. And does he currently need it? What is it? So Supplemental Security Income is like some monthly cheque that he will get from the government or he will get, and people apply for it. For example, for physical disability, mental disability, if they cannot get employment for any of those reasons. Then sometimes that qualifies them to apply for it. I think that he probably needs to get it, because he wants his own room. And so that would be more rent for me. And I think that he needs to be responsible to pay that. So yeah, I think that he probably would need that. And he has not, or you or him have not applied for SSI? No. And why was the reason for not applying? I didn't know I could. Yeah. That's what we hear a lot of times. And it's not quite telling if you go to try to find information for these services online: who can or cannot apply. Yeah. What about SSDI, that's Social Security Disability Insurance. Would it be based on mine? SSDI would be based on his. I don't want to give a lot because you'll be learning about this when you attend the sessions. Oh, okay. Or when you get the materials. But SSDI, a lot of times when, when you meet their definition of disability for SSI, a lot of times you also get SSDI, which is a disability for someone who's receiving those benefits from the government. And that's the insurance part of it. He's going to need that when he's off on my insurance. Most definitely when he turns 26. What about vocational rehab services? Like VR or something that would help with employment, is he getting that? No. Does he currently need that? Yes. And why is he not receiving? Have you guys ever applied for VR services and why not? Because I didn't know that it was available for him. And I'm not saying it is, it depends. So it might. Yes. I understand. But even the experts on these things sometimes are like, we don't. I mean, you have to go the application and see and- I wouldn't even know where to go for the application, I guess, online? You learn, but yes, some of them can be  You start online and then you mail some documents or you have to go physically show some documents somewhere. Oh, Okay. Yeah. Have you heard about the Medicaid waiver services, or is he getting that? No. And Medicaid long term services and supports? No. You have never heard of it and he's not getting it? No. Right. Do you have any legal protections for him? Like a power of attorney, healthcare, surrogate, guardianship to make decisions that we have- If we've signed papers? No. No. Is that something that he currently needs? Yes. Why hasn't that been set up? So have you ever applied for conservatorship for him? Mm-mm . What was the reason for not applying? He can do most stuff for himself. And I just felt he still lives with me, so I'm basically making all the decisions anyway. Yeah. So I just hadn't felt like I needed to at this time. And have you set up a special needs trust, or enable account for him at all? Have you heard about them?  I've heard a little about them. Is that something that you think he currently needs? I don't know. I mean, it's not- Yeah. I don't think so. It's not also  what ramifications those have once you set them up, how they can. I guess I would need to know more about it. Yeah. And he's not getting housing choice, voucher section eight. Is that something that he currently needs? No. Because he's going to live with me. And he's not on Medicare or TennCare or- No. ... or insurance? No. And he doesn't need it now, but he'll need it once. I think so. Yeah. Once he's turns 26 and he's off of my insurance, then he'll need that. Yeah. Okay. Great. Now these are other services that are not maybe better protection, but that he still may be getting or not, any speech or language therapy? No. And he doesn't need that? I don't think, no. He doesn't need that. And audiology services for hearing problems? No. Any assistive technology devices? No. And he doesn't-  He doesn't need that. No Orientation and mobility services, like that could even be someone who's driving him to work, like a driver. I think he could probably use that, because he pays for a lift when I'm at work and I can't take him to work. So yeah, he could probably use that. And physical therapy? No, he doesn't need that. No nursing care? No. And he doesn't need that? No. And I'm assuming you don't have a personal assistant or in . No. No respite care? No. Is that needed? No. No social work services? No Psychological or mental health services or counseling? No, because I could use my own insurance for that. And medical services for diagnosis? So he's not getting any counseling? No. I did have him take counseling when he was in junior high and the therapist said that he didn't need it basically, is what she said. And then medical services or any type of health related issues, like sleep issues or any other issue that may be related to autism or no? No. And he doesn't need it? He doesn't need it. Any training and independent living skill, like any management? I think that he could use independent living skills. He could most definitely use that. He's never had it and he is not getting it, but yeah  But he would need or- Yeah, absolutely. I know he's not getting any type of housing assistance or services like a supervised group home, but is that something that he would need in the future? When I'm not here, I would like for him to live on his own, have his own place. Yeah. So no. And i think he would probably want to live alone. So he's not getting any type of vocational services, like job training, physical training, shadow internships. But do you think that, that is currently needed? Yes. And financially, he's not currently getting that, right? No. Is that something that is currently needed, some aid to pay for college or even if it's a technical school for training? Yes. He would need that. To pay for school or college. Yes. And education, like tutoring, he's not getting that now, but is that something he would need?  I think he would need. Yes. And he's not going to an adult daycare or a day center? No. And that's not because- He  if he did need that. I'm assuming you don't have a case manager or someone who's coordinating this services and he's really not getting any services? He's not getting any services.\n",
            "finishOkay. Okay. And so you mentioned earlier that he graduated high school but that he will be involved in a transition program, correct? Yeah. Okay. And is he currently working? He's not. Okay. And we... This- He was before the pandemic, but he quit. And this is just something that we ask of everybody, but why is he not currently working or what barriers is he experiencing to being able to work right now? He actually has an opportunity to go back to his old job at Amazon Bookstore, but he doesn't want to. It's a barrier. Yeah, of course. And has he worked and left any job since the last time we spoke last time we spoke In January? No. And what about volunteering in the community since that time? No. Okay. Okay. And so now we'll switch gears again and we'll talk-\n",
            "finishOkay. So, your mom was telling my friend, that you were talking to earlier, about some things that you did, that do now and that you've done before, like education programs and stuff like that. So I just wanted to know what you think about these things. So let's see, it looks like your mom was telling Flora about Nashville State, so- Yeah, that's where I go to community college. Yeah, so do you think that this program is a good fit for you? Yeah, because history, when I was a kid, especially throughout middle school or high school, was always my strongest subject. But I always managed in college even with a D and a C the second time I took... But it was for a different math class. So I managed to pass those classes with a C so, and so the first math I took in college, I managed best with a D so... That's awesome. So, were there any other reasons that you think that it's a good fit for you? No. I think that was the only reason because... Like you passing your classes? Yeah, and also one thing is I also, my strength was also history, so that's why I changed my major. Oh, okay. To history, because that was- What was it before? It was surgical technology. Oh wow. And then the classes were really hard. I mean the assignments weren't hard. It was just, the class was hard for me and that's what my... Because I usually go through my, I have accommodations that I have through the access center there. So it's like that I, or the special needs center for all the kids that go to school there that there she said that was the hard, those classes I've taken. And I got Fs in, those were very hard classes, almost like, nope. So I just changed it to history because I'm like, I know all this stuff. And plus that was always my strongest subject in school, that and science. And so you said that people in accommodations suggested that you move to history or you just thought of that by yourself? Myself. Oh, okay. Sorry, I just wanted to make sure I understood completely. Yeah, but no, for any class I take, I have accommodations. So it doesn't matter the major I have, it's just for any of my classes, no matter the major I changed to. And have these been helpful for you? Mm-hmm . I mean, I had to use some of them used my... So there's this one where I can get papers. I forgot what it was called. Do you get more time to write them? Mm-hmm , more time to get them done. And I'm almost done with my first history paper, but that's because he gives them our prompts in advance, too. And he gives us time to do them and stuff. So I just went ahead started and then, and that, why I started mine early is because I want to get it looked over and stuff like that from the writing center.And also, I get extended time on tests. So, and I can make an appointment because my tests have to be proctored. And I asked my teacher if I would be counted absent and he said I wouldn't because that day we're just taking the test and leaving. Okay. So you get extra time on tests and you're able to talk to your teachers when you need something? Or yeah, I ask them because with my teachers, when I take my test at the... Like in the... Because I took my test in a different building because it needed to be proctored. So I usually take it in one the rooms in the learning center at my college, or community college. So that way someone's there to proctor my test and stuff like that, but they usually put the test in the testing center. I just have to make the appointment. Okay. Got it. And I said, I asked him, am I going to be... And usually those days, test days, I'm not considered absent, even though they know I'm taking a test. Because I don't think they take... I mean, even with Ms. Genevieve, she knew I was taking a test somewhere else, but she... I was like, \"Hey, when I take a test somewhere else, am I considered absent?\" She said, \"No, because you're just taking your test. Because that's what we normally do when we take a test in college is that you just take it and leave.\" And I said, \"Hey, am I going to...\" Because I scheduled mine for 11:10, my test. And I said, \"Hey, I scheduled my test for 11:10, yada, yada, yada do I,\" it was like, \"Do I need to come to class that day?\" And he's like, \"No, because all they're doing that day is just taking the test, so...\" That makes sense. And he's like, \"Yeah, if you want to stop by.\" And he said I won't be considered absent because all they're doing that day is just taking the test. So it sounds like you are really comfortable with talking to your teachers about what you need and about... Yeah. That's great. Because you know what? A lot of people get nervous to talk to their teachers. Yeah. And then, especially with my new advisor, he's on a completely different campus, but it's... And I had, I asked them to change it. They had changed it, but it never got changed in the computer for some reason. Change what? My advisor for my major, because it's someone from another campus so I can't go, because I'm not going to that campus because I go to the main one off of White Bridge. So, but they just never changed it in the system, I guess. That's weird, yeah. But it's good that you asked them to. Yeah. But, because this one I have now is because of... Okay, let's see. Okay. So, it also says here that you worked for the Red Cross and an animal shelter? Well, I volunteered for the Red Cross. Okay. That's awesome. Yeah. I had to do community service for Tennessee Promise and- Was this in high school or outside of high school? No, this was outside high school. Well, no, the animal shelter was in high school. The Red Cross was in college, but I just never, I just had to find a place that would be a right time for me. That's what it was, was I couldn't find... Some of them were like in Antioch or somewhere else. So I just had to find one where it was good for me, timing wise. So I just went to one in the morning, so at 9:00, but I had to leave at 12:00 because I had class, because I had... Yeah. And so the animal shelter was during high school? Yes, and the Red Cross was during... College? Yeah. So, I was wondering if you could talk to me a little bit about that, what you did there? Which one? The Red Cross. So the Red Cross is that when everyone would sign in for an appointment, because it was a blood drive. And so, I would just write people's names on tags and just check them in and just tell them where to go. That's all I basically did. Okay, and let's see. And you don't currently, still do this? Uh-uh . Not anymore? Okay. And do you remember how you found this activity? I forgot. I was wanting to find some place to volunteer and... Did you just maybe find it online? I don't know. I read something because the Red Cross comes to my school for a blood drive.  So I think that's where I maybe found out about it, about the Red Cross was from there. From your college? Yeah. Community College? Because usually they come there for blood drives for my community college. Because they usually have signs about events and stuff that's going on in those days. Okay. And do you remember how many hours per week that you worked there? It was only that one day I did it. Oh, okay. Yeah, because I needed to do some community service work for Tennessee Promise because we had to do eight hours of community service for Tennessee Promise. And what's Tennessee Promise? It's a scholarship where students, it's like a backup scholarship that takes place after financial aid and stuff like that. Okay. Let's see. Okay. And, so do you remember how many hours you worked there? Was it eight? I think so. Okay. Because it was from... But, and then the animal shelter was me in my sophomore year of high school. And so for the... Do you remember when you went to the Red Cross to volunteer? What- It was sometime in the spring and sometime in April. Sometime in April? Yeah. And it was just that one time? Yeah. Okay, awesome. And, okay. I think it was the 12th of April or something like that, that day. Okay. And my next question is, do you think that this was a good fit for you? Yes, because I wasn't really taking any blood. I was just checking people in. And what else did you like about this type of work? If you liked anything else. I mean, there were some down sides. I mean, you kind of got bored, just waiting for people to show up. And so you left because it was just part of the community service? And then when it was done you didn't go back? Yeah, mm-hmm . And then the animal shelter was the same thing, but it was like more sophomore year of class. Okay. And do you have anything else that you want to say about the Red Cross? Or if not, that's okay. No, nothing else comes to mind. Okay. Great, awesome.\n",
            "finishAnd so his high school situation, he's still in high school and taking virtual school? And did his graduation plans change since the last time we spoke? No, but he's supposed to graduate in May, and I'm sure it's going to look a lot different than what we thought. And he's not currently working. And you said that because he's high risk. And so before, though, he was working at Amazon. So, how did he find that job at Amazon? I have a friend who is very high up there, and helped us get it. And he was working at the Amazon bookstore? Yes. And how many hours a week, on average, did he work there? Oh, gosh. I'm not sure. He was going with school. Somebody from school was going with him to interpret and help him. It was just a few hours a day, maybe three times a week. So maybe 10 hours a week, possibly? Yeah. About that. And he began working there, was that last January that he started that? I think so. Yeah. And when did he stop working there? Probably in March. And can you tell me a bit about the job and what he did there? He did scanning with a scanner for stuff that needed to be stocked on shelves. He did unpacking boxes, replacing things on the shelves that were out of stock. Stuff like that. And you said that he received support through school. So what kind of support did he receive? He had an interpreter/kind of job coach, just somebody with him, helping him stay on track. That's great. And so he chose to leave because of COVID in March. And did you feel like this job was a good fit for his skills and interests? Yeah. It was great. And what made it a good fit? Just he really enjoyed it. He liked working with the little scanner item because he loves technology. They were very supportive. They were really excited about having him there. It was just good all around. And it was across the street from school. It was really easy to just walk over there. Oh, that's awesome. Yes. And has he volunteered in the community since the last time we spoke? Yes. He was going to Friends Life after school one day a week, and they would go and do stuff like . I think they went to a church and set up some stuff for a dinner they had once a week. He did a few things in January, February. So he did things with Friends Life. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us about or any other updates? No. Okay. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me today, Assist would not be possible without your participation. So we really appreciate it. And the last thing that we.\n",
            "finishThis one will go over activities that he's been involved in. And I imagine he's not really been involved in too many. No. Unfortunately. I just wanted to clarify his high school situation. So he hasn't been receiving any services through the school system, correct? Correct. And did his high school plans or track change since we last spoke? No. And when did he exit the system and exit high school? Well, he's always been homeschooled to some degree since probably second grade. So from second to eighth grade, there was partial school and partial me homeschooling him. And then at the beginning of when he was to be a freshman in high school, I took over homeschooling altogether. And what year did he graduate, and month? He graduated in 2018 in June. Okay. And what type of diploma did you receive? Your traditional high school diploma. Okay. And so for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about programs that he's been involved in since we last spoke. And I know we've already kind of gone over this and it sounds like there haven't been too many activities, but first I'd like to ask about what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? He sleeps a lot. He spend a lot of time on the computer doing preferred activities on preferred subjects. He's very interested in animals. So he looks up tons of facts and information and photos of all kinds of different animals, it doesn't matter what kind of animal, he loves it. And he does share that with me and he'll show me cute little videos he finds of different animals, or he'll tell me something he's learned about an animal. He spends a lot of time doing that. The 3D stuff that he does, that's kind of on and off. He'll kind of binge on it for a while, and then he'll kind of take a break from it. Playing with his dog. One thing that really helped us a lot, we had a pregnant stray kitten that somebody dropped the portal thing at our house. And so we took her in and started trying to tame her. And then when she had her babies and she brought them to us, we took care of them and found them homes. And so that was our best time during the whole COVID, was raising the little kittens and finding them homes and feeding them and petting them and all that. Oh, that's so sweet. Yeah, and let's see. That's probably about it. Oh, watching, he loves these B grade movies. So he and I have been binging on that. Oh, that's so fun. Yeah, I mean like stuff like all those different shark movies, they're just kind of off the wall. They're not your typical movie theater movies. Oh, that's funny. Well, that's a fun time. And you mentioned that he has not had any changes in his schooling or work activities since we last spoke, okay? No. Is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any updates that you would like to share with us? I thought of something a while ago, but now I can't remember it. It was something, I don't know if y'all have a place for, if we think of something that might be helpful in case you do either the mail out materials or training. Yeah, we can talk about that here, definitely. Unfortunately, I cannot remember what it was. It was something I thought this would've really, really helped if I had known it, but now I don't know what it was. Oh, not a problem. You actually think of it. You can email it to transitions@vomc.org and I'll be sending you an email from that email address later today. Yeah. Okay. Well, thank you so much. It was great to catch up. Oh, I know what it was, but actually this was covered, so nevermind. It was covered. It just, I had not been informed yet. I was not in the know, and that was when I first applied for his SSI. I didn't realize that by me having more than $2,000 in a checking account with his name on it would make it where he couldn't get any assistance. Well, I'm really glad that it was covered and that you were able to get that service for him in the end. Okay. Well, thank you so much for-\n",
            "finishSo just to clarify, he is still in high school at this time and he's going in person? And did his high school plans or graduation plans change since the last time we spoke? No, I don't think so. And when is he planning on exiting high school? Do you know the month and year? It'll be May. Okay. And so he's not currently working and that's because his VR program shut down due to COVID? Yes. Okay. And so it sounds like he was working somewhere since the last time we spoke in January, but then it shut down. Correct. And so how many jobs was he working before they shut down? Just one. And did he receive payment at that job? No. So now I'm going to ask for more details about that job. And you said he worked at Carrabbas? Yes. And he found that job through school? Yes. And how many hours a week on average did he work at this job? I think four. Oh, there you are. I couldn't see you for a minute. Sorry. I was getting a phone call. Oh, no problem. So how many hours a week on average do you think he worked there? Four. Four, okay. And do you remember the month and year he started working there? I think it was January. And did he stop around March? Yes. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about the job and what he did there? I really don't know, but I think he helped put down chairs. He put out silverware, salt and pepper shakers, stuff like that. Before they opened. Okay. And did he receive support while working? Yes. And what kinds of support did he receive? I mean, he had a 101. Through the school. And it sounded like his reason for leaving was because the program shut down when COVID hit. And do you think that this was a good fit for his skills and interests? I don't really, I mean they said he did but I don't think so. And you say you don't think so, what do you think made it maybe not the best fit for him? Say that again. So you said you didn't think it was the best fit for him. And I was wondering what reasons were there do you think for it not being the best fit for him? I just don't really see how he could do the job with his skillset, but maybe that's me. I probably don't but anyway. I mean, I never went there. I never saw exactly what he was doing. So maybe I shouldn't be judging that without really knowing. And then I know he's so personal that he probably just want to talk to everybody instead of doing the job. And has he volunteered in the community since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And is there anything else that you would like to share with us or any updates that you would like to tell us about? No. Okay.\n",
            "finishOkay. So if I'm with you, I'm going to record this, but I'm going to ask about Rainey experiences when she finished. So when she was in high school, if she did any volunteering experiences or any internships and after finishing high school. So anything you don't remember, we don't have to talk to that, but was she working or volunteering during high school? Rainey went to the Nashville, Big Picture College Preparatory High School. If you know anything about that high school, it's a project based learning high school with only 200 students. You have to be handpicked and selected and interviewed. So a huge program to where parents are involved as well. Rainey did Metro school work three days a week, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, the other two days. She interned in the community. So her sophomore year, she was at the downtown library working in the children's book section, her sophomore year, she worked at the Goodwill and hated it. And then her junior, senior year she worked at a daycare on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Wow. That's a lot. Was she getting paid for any of those or those were- No. Okay. She's never worked a paid job. Okay. And you said, so two days a week, is that average for those three experiences? The daycare, Goodwill and then library? That was required. She would go to school Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Tuesday, Thursday. She interned for nine to two. Okay. And she had to report to the school. She had to call when she got there to let them know she was there when she was leaving and so forth. I was telling her that it's a project based. So at the end of every nine weeks, Rainey had do a 30 minute PowerPoint presentation about what she learned for that nine weeks. She also had to do a volunteer somewhere. She would go to the animal shelter or whatever, and do so many hours per semester. She also does that now for the Tennessee promise that she just lost. That I'm having to file in a pill for, because she failed her two medical classes last semester. Because she really had no business being in the medical classes. I'm sorry for that. But the school somehow. Yeah. I hope they will revisit that and get it back to her. Because she's great. She told me a little bit about this and high school. She's amazing. When she's at home though, the hygiene and all, that's a major issue. She gets mad at us. She cusses me underneath her breath it's terrible. She doesn't want to listen. Yeah. Well that's something that a lot of youth that age and also in that transition period struggle with, so I'm sure you're not the only... Even I would say my mom with me and my brother got those when we were 20 to... So now she's in a community college is that? Yes. And then is she doing anything else as far as volunteering or? She goes to school two days a week and then she goes to a friend's life community two days a week. And it's the friend's life community. Like last semester on Tuesdays, she did drama class and on Thursdays they did Meals on Wheels. This time she's doing drama class on Tuesday and swim on Thursdays. And then they have other classes in between about group and self-help and things like that. Okay. Perfect. And is that volunteering or is it something else? No, I paid $500 a month for her to go there. Yeah. So it's more like a club. It's a private. Yes, but Ms. Nina highly recommended it after I had told her that's where I had Rainey. She said we're very blessed to have a place like that in Nashville. Yeah. Now she was telling me that she had to leave earlier today. So let's talk for a moment about community college. What college is she in? Nashville State. Nashville State. Okay. And what program is she taking? I guess, does she have a major? She's went back and forth, but she's finally by to what she should have been with in the beginning and stuck with, which is history major. Because she excels in history in science. She knows everything you need to know about history. She can tell you anywhere from who formed the Red Cross, why they formed a Red Cross, who went to the Holocaust. She knows everything about history. And she's working towards an associate's degree or bachelors? Associate's right now. And how many classes is she taking per semester? On average. She's taken two this semester. Because the program allows her to do that. And so is she a full-time or part-time student? Part time. Part time? I don't know. Do you remember- Part time? I guess. Do you remember when she started this program? Nashville State? Yes. This semester after- Or when she started. She graduated and went straight to college that following fall. So fall 2018. 2018, she graduated in May and started in August. So August 2018. Okay. And is she receiving any support for that program? No. Well, what do you mean? Like a tutor, not something that is school has in place for everybody, but a special tutor for her or extended time for testing? No, the school has tutors and stuff that she goes to. Yeah, she takes her test in a quiet area and has more time on her test than the average student does. Okay, great. And was she involved in any other program previously to that? No. She always was in- She's in the IEP program at school. She was always in the IEP from first grade all the way up until she graduated. But she hasn't been in a different community college and changed or? Yeah. Great. And you said she never had a paying job. What about internships or any volunteering opportunities after high school? The volunteering she's done is the requirements for the Tennessee promise. So she's worked for the Red Cross. She's done the animal shelters, those type things. And is that currently or in the past? Yes. And then she did Meals on Wheels last year at the end of the year, with the Fred Black community. Okay, great. Okay. We can go with that. So we might have some follow up questions for you in the future, but we can get all of the information later so that we can get through most of we need. I have every evaluation Rainey's ever had done since the age of six months in a box. If y'all wanted to evaluate her from here all the way up. Just one that says autism, that would be enough But I mean, if you want to see how-\n",
            "finishBen is still in high school, correct?  Yes.  Yes. Just making sure. And he's worked during high school or not quite yet, he didn't start? No, he hasn't started. They've been letting him work within the school. So he goes a couple days a week to cosmetology and they let him fold towels or whatever in there. They're probably really just cater to him, but I don't know what he does, but he loves going through it, but they wash his hair and all that. But supposedly, that's him getting ready to go to work. He turned 16 in October and so this semester was when he was supposed to start work, but he hasn't yet. Okay. And so when he goes to cosmetology, how many hours a week do you think he- I think it's only however longer a class is, like an hour and few minutes. I don't know.  So like one hour per week? Yeah. Okay. And do you know when he started it? When he was in the ninth grade, so a year ago. Okay. Do you remember what month he would've started that? Mm-mm , I don't. Yeah, so I could just say January, a year ago. And does he currently still go? I mean, as far as I know, I really don't know. Yeah, is he at school? And this is part of school programming? Yes. And so you say he folds towels. What else does he do there? That's far as I know, he'll come home and before I knew he was doing it, he'd come home and go, \"Fix hair, fix hair.\" I'm like, \"What is he...?\" And then finally, the next couple days when I talked to his teacher was like, \"Has he been telling you about going to cosmetology?\" And that's a really hard word for him to say too, so. Oh, I imagine. It's a lot of syllables. And I think he can finally somewhat say it, but I didn't know what he was trying to tell me. So I was like, \"Oh, that's what he is talking about.\" And she goes, \"Usually boys wouldn't go, she goes, but one day he was so...\" And he has a couple typical peers that are in cosmetology that come to his class. So he already loves them and so they end up... She was like, I guess, because anyway, he just ended up loving it and they loved him. So she was like, \"We've kept letting him go.\" That's great. And so does he receive support while working? Uh-huh . And what kind of support does he have? I'm sure they all help. I mean, like I can't really see him folding a towel without help. Do you think a teacher helps him or maybe a classmate? Probably the classmates. Yeah. And so do you think this job is a good fit for his skills and interests? Hmm. I guess. I'm not really sure. It sounds like he likes it. Yeah, he does. And did he, or does he volunteer at all in any program? No. Okay. And is there anything else that you'd like to elaborate on with this job? Or you said he's also about to start a new one. Mm-hmm . I wish I'd kind of knew what that was going to be. I don't. Okay. Well, great. That one was a short one.\n",
            "finishOkay. So, her high school situation, we've talked quite a bit about that, and so I just wanted to clarify, is she receiving any services through the school system at this time? No. Okay. Okay, and I'll make a note of that. So did her high school tracker plans change? Any graduation plans change since the last time we spoke or did She kind of graduate on track? Well, she got a regular diploma. She didn't get a special education diploma, but, with that said there was still the inference that she would not do well, in an academic setting. Mm-hmm . And so, when we last spoke in February was the plan to get a regular diploma or a special diploma? Regular. Okay, and she got a regular diploma. So for the rest of the interview, I'll ask about programs that she's been involved in since last February. So first I'd like to get an idea of how she normally spends her time. So, what does a typical week look like for her? How has she been spending her time? During this... Well, she stays up late, and she goes to sleep so late, which is not the norm before this. I mean, she's always liked to stay up later than she should, but now there's no real reason to get up at a normal time. So she's a late sleeper, and she takes care of her chores without too much reminding, sometimes a little more than others. She, like I said, she would be on... She is on those video games way too much. Now that we have the dog, She does get outside several times a day with him. But I mean, her life is... Her function that she looks forward to every day, is those video games. That, and the... I don't know what they call them. The little things where they sing videos, sing song videos, YouTube, or something. I don't know, something like that. I mean, that's her goal to be able to get to do that during the day. There really isn't much else. I can't get her interested in any hobbies. So it's been pretty, to me it would be extremely boring. I don't like to do the same thing over and over again, but she's quite happy with that. And just to confirm- But I do... Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Oh, no problem. Sorry I interrupted, please continue. No, that's okay. That really said everything I guess. Mm-hmm. So just to confirm, since graduating in May, she's not been enrolled in an education program or a job after high school? That is true. Okay. Well, thank you so much. Is there anything else that you would like to update us on or anything else that you would like to share? No. I just thank you all for the program. I learned a lot. Oh, I'm so glad to hear that. I probably... I've forgotten a lot too, but I have notes, so I will...\n",
            "finishAnd just confirming what you said that she is out of high school and not receiving any services through the school system currently? Yeah. Did she exit the school system since the last time we talked in April? That would've been May.. Okay. For this section, I'm going to ask about some academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that she's been involved in since this year, April, the last time we spoke, but first I'd like to get an idea of how she spends her time. What does a typical week look like for her and how has she been spending her time? She goes to Bridges twice a week. This summer she did the Lipscomb Academy. She's very hyper focused about lip school. She's completed at her personal statement video to submit her application. So that's kind of been a very, her focus. She's very much into social media posting and she's part of the State Youth Advisory Council. She'd been a part of those meetings. That's great. You said the State Youth Advisory Council? Mm-hmm. That's awesome. That's really impressive. How many hours a week does she spend at her internship? She there on Wednesday and Thursday from 9:00 to around 4:15. Okay. Both days. About 14 hours a week. And is this internship paid or unpaid? It's unpaid. Okay. You mentioned that she'd been enrolled at Lipscomb Academy. Is that a post-secondary education program? It was a summer academy. It was like three days for people that didn't get in, just to see for them to get a feel for people. Before applications were submitted for 22-23. That was just the three day program for people that were in for this current semester. It get a feel what campus was like and all that. To support applicants who maybe didn't get in this year, but want to apply for next year. Yeah. That's great. Has she been enrolled in any sort of academic program since the last time we spoke in April, other than this? Other than the academy, that's it. Okay. She is currently at Bridges for her internship. Can you describe what she does there? She greets people from the front desk. She will help set up rooms of their are meetings, she does scanning, she answers the phone, files paperwork. Those are things that I know. That's great. Does she receive supports while she's working? Everybody there that she works with consign, so she's in an environment where it's inclusive. So, it's a very supportive environment. That's, really great to have that level of support. Yeah. They've known her a long time, so it's not like she's new to them. So they know her. How did she kind of going off of that? How did she find this internship? Just because she'd been at Bridges for a long time and when she didn't get into Lipscomb, it was a way to her to get some job experiences at not being an attendee at Bridges, but making that transition of like, \"oh, now I'm going to be in a role of working with staff\". They presented the opportunity through her and she was like, yes. That's great. And I'm so sorry, I'm just going to move my cat who's trying to get in on this interview. She's being distractive. They want to be on. She really loves being, taking the spotlight on Zoom. So, I mentioned it was a great way to give her job experience kind of without being an attendee necessarily. And that they presented this opportunity Yeah. Different than being part of the program and you're doing all this stuff where now your staff, so you're going to, it's different. Definitely, but also in a place that knows you and you know, the people that usually come in. Do you remember the month and year that she started working there? I think it was June- And do you think it's been a good fit for her skills and interests? Yes. I think she gets to be around people and just learn different things. She's all about scanning. Which I just find funny. I think she's learned different skills where she's more comfortable being at the front desk. People need assistance, so definitely has helped her develop different skills that could be beneficial in a different job setting . And do you have any additional comments about Bridges or? No? Okay. They've been very good to us. So we are we're really, I mean, yeah. Has she participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke in April? No. Okay. She hasn't  think like, no. Okay. Just a moment and then we're going to continue to the next set of questions. Next we're going to talk.\n",
            "finishNow, we'll move on to talking about her activities that she might be involved in. And so, you mentioned that she graduated high school since the last time we spoke. Was this in May of this year? Yes. Well, actually June. June, okay. And so, what does a typical week look like for Caroline? How has she been spending her time? Well, this summer, mostly at home, some doing the voc rehab virtually, working with her ADA person virtually. And then, we did some trips this summer. But now that she's back at school, typically, we leave the house between 7:00 and 7:30, depending on the day. She goes and has breakfast at her college, and then goes to her classes. And then after her classes are over, depending on which day it is, we're still trying to figure it out. Her twin brother just went back to school last week, Wednesday was his first day, so he was actually picking her up. So this is our first week of trying to figure out how to get Caroline home. One day she walked home, other days I've been able to either pick her up or she waited until I was finished at work and then came and got her. We are in the process of starting to learn how to use the bus, as I'm hopeful maybe that will happen. But yesterday, she went ahead of us to walk to the bus stop and got lost. Oh, no, I'm so sorry to hear that. And so,  her and get her in right place. So we haven't done the bus home yet. Right now, we're just trying to learn how to do it in the morning. We're trying to go that route because it's cheaper and it's scheduled. So she can plan around that, which is a lot, I think in some ways, better than the Paratransit it system. Because the Paratransit, you have to schedule that at least a day ahead of time. And then, there's this window of 30 minutes that they may come, but yet they'll only wait five minutes if you're not right there. And so, that's just a lot of uncertainty and that is just not good for Caroline. I think if she knows that the bus will be there at a certain time and she's in control of that situation. But having to wait 40 minutes and not know if they're going to show or not, because we had that happen in Nashville, that they just didn't even show up. I mean, that's just very, very stressful. Oh, I imagine. And how many total hours does she spend with school related activities or on the vocational training classes, on an average week? I think the voc rehab is, I don't know if it's one hour a week or one and a half hours a week, but it's about that. And then the classes, she's taking 12 credit hours this semester. How many hours does she spend on school related activities outside of her credit hours? And that could be studying or anything school related. I do not know, to be honest. I know she met with one of her teachers yesterday. I know she's been working on a paper, but I don't know how much time she spends on homework. What is the name of the school that she is enrolled in? She goes to Edgewood College. Edgewood College. Also, I'm so sorry, it seems like they have started construction close to me. So if you hear that, I really apologize if that's disruptive. I can try to move if that ends up being disruptive, so please, please let me know. You're fine. And can you tell me a little bit about this program? Edgewood College? Mm-hmm . It's a small, parochial, liberal arts college. I guess you could say it's sort of like... Oh, why am I blanking, the Nashville Catholic all girls school. Is it Aquinas College that's there? It's all on that one campus, so they have an elementary school, middle school, high school and a college on this really beautiful piece of land. And so, she's going to that college and it's about a mile from our house. I don't know how many students are enrolled, but it's a small campus. And it's basically  all the way around and the people are incredibly nice. They were the very first school, college, university in Wisconsin to have programs designed for people with cognitive disabilities. And that's the Cutting Edge Program, which is now evolved into other programs, as well. But they were the very first one. I mean, I went to her first day of orientation before her therapist came. The students were incredibly nice to Caroline and very patient. And teachers, her professors that we met, they gave us a template to use that she could send out to her teachers to tell them a little bit about her and give them a copy of her accommodation plan that we had developed with the Student Support Office. They just really seem to be on the ball with that kind of stuff. And, just really have encouraged the students to do the office hours and take advantage of all the different, like the writing labs and the math labs and the science labs and just all this kind of stuff to help the kids be successful. Just really impressive. That's wonderful to hear, that it... It's a very inclusive campus. And is this an inclusive... So she is in the program, correct, for all students, regardless of ability? She got admitted based on just a regular college application. What is her area of study? She does not know yet. She doesn't know what her major is- Or, the classes that she's taking? ... she is taking statistics, a literature English class, a communications class and what's her other one? So four classes, English, communications, math. I think that's really it, because her math class has a second math workshop-type thing to help them be successful with the statistics. So maybe those are the four classes. The two maths, introduction to communication and then a literature class. And you said that she started in August of this year? Yes. Great. Does she receive supports from the program? Yes. And what kind of  supports does she receive? She gets extended test time. They provided her with a program, which I don't know if she's going to use yet or not, for note taking. They will help with getting digital texts, if we are not able to purchase it through the bookstore. I would have to go back and look at everything that was on that list. If she needs to leave the classroom, she can leave the classroom if she gets overstimulated. She's supposed to meet with the coordinator once every three weeks to touch base on things. And then, he also has made arrangements for Caroline to meet with the student to help, I don't want to suggest organizing, but also learning how to use all the different computer programs that they use there. So Blackboard and, I mean, just all the different systems that they use to teach. And so, she has that person that she's supposed to be meeting with. There's probably more things that I can't think of top of my head now. Oh, no problem. And so, do you think this has been a good fit for her? Yes, I do. I do. And what makes it a good fit? Location and just the programs that they have there. Yeah, I mean, they're just really, really nice and they want the kids to be successful, regardless of their background, what they bring. They're totally invested in the kids. I mean, it's impressive. That's great. And do you have any additional comments about this program? No. Okay. Is she currently participating in any employment or volunteering activities? No. Okay. I'm hoping next semester that they'll be okay with her trying to apply for work study, but they don't want her to do that her first semester. Okay.\n",
            "finishOkay. Your mom and I talked a little bit about some programs that you're involved in. Mm-hmm . I just wanted to ask you a few quick questions about those. She says right now you're enrolled in TSU? Mm-hmm . Do you feel like this program's a good fit? Yeah, for now, yeah. Yeah? And- Considering the situation I was in at first at MTSU, it's better. Yeah? Let's see... What makes it better? What do you like about it? It's smaller, the staff is a little bit more better. It's towards the end, so it's pretty, . And it's almost open? Yeah. It's definitely how I felt too at the end. Do you have anything else that you'd like to say about this program? If not, that's fine too. Mm-mm . Okay. Then, about MTSU and you felt like this was not a good fit? Mm-mm . And what reasons? I had some professor... I had the Dean kind of like... I think they knew I had autism the first day in and they kind of done intimidating things,  at the classroom, kind of keep an eye on me and stuff like that. That's really messed up. Yeah, mm-hmm . Well, I'm glad you got out and also a big campus. Mm-hmm . Okay, when you chose to leave, can you describe the circumstances around that? Talking about the reason I left, or? Yeah. It's because of that and this month they didn't want me in art department and it seemed like it was moving room for me to even get past the art classes at that point. It was a big school and it was stressful and the support was going downhill so I had to be... I was forcing myself in a situation that I just... I should have been left and kind of stayed there. Yeah, I know a lot of people who end up staying in programs and not liking them instead of transferring because they're like, \"I might as well just stay\", then they transfer in the end and there so much happier. Yeah, mm-hmm . Do you have anything else that you'd like to add about this one? Mm-mm . Okay.\n",
            "finishFor the next one, I'll just talk about some activities that she currently does and has done in the past. So, did she ever work during high school? And did she ever volunteer during high school? And what does her typical week look like now? Home. She's got class, we're doing all online, but she's got two art classes, but they combine them in one. So, she goes to class now on Tuesday nights, but for the most part, she's just home. Okay. And how many total hours during the average week does she spend participating in her activities like class? An hour. So, you said she takes some online too? Oh, you're talking about those too? Are you talking about  All the classes? That would be a lot. Do you think, maybe like 15 to 20? A week? Probably more than that. Oh, wow. Yeah. Because yeah, this semester. Yeah. Or like 30? 25? She's painting on average, about four hours for those two classes, about four hours a day. Wow, Oh my God. Yeah, because it's a senior show and the show is the first or second week in March. So, that's like a 40 hour? Yeah, because it's two classes. You got the portfolio and the senior exhibit together, but he's doing it that one night a week, where they meet. But they're doing all this work outside to get ready, for the senior exhibit, the show, the art show. She's averaging about four hours a week with that. And then we sit down and do her psychology, her abnormal and her developmental class. We're probably putting in; I'm going to say maybe five hours a week right now. Let's say about, let's say 30. 30? Okay. Yeah. Let's say 30. And so, she is currently enrolled in college and what's the name of the college that she's enrolled in? She's at TSU. And can you tell me a little bit about the program, and about maybe like the accommodations that she receives and the type of degree that she's going to get? She's going for a Bachelor's of Science and Studio Art, with a minor in Psychology. She's going to stay and get her master's in Counseling Psychology. Wow. So she can do art therapy. The accommodations are almost none, it's really hard to fight for those accommodations there. And so, what, her area of study one was art, and then what was the other one? She's majoring in Studio Art, but she's minoring in Psychology. Oh, okay. So she can do her master's in Counseling Psychology. So, BA in Studio Art and a minor in Psychology? No, it's a BS. Oh, sorry She went because she wanted the BS because she's doing the Psychology part of it. It's only two schools here that had the BS, and that was MTSU and TSU. So, when she left MTSU, that was probably about the only option she had with doing the BS. And so, what is the number of classes that she's currently taking? Four. And is she full-time, then I imagine? And what year and month did she start this program? August. And in terms of accommodations, you say she's pretty much not receiving any right now? And is that, why is she not receiving any right now? Disability services at TSU is crap. Okay. She at MTSU, she got them, they're just. Okay. And so, she was enrolled in another program before MTSU? She was at, she was at MTSU before. And can you tell me a little bit about that and what was she also, still doing the BS in Studio Art BS in Art Practices at MTSU and minoring in Psychology. And what is the average number of classes she was taking there? She's always taking and just four. Okay. And do you remember when she started that program? That's when she started August at TSU. Okay. I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about the whole thing. TSU was fall. So that was August, and MTSU was August. Okay. August until what date? Approximately? It would've been probably August. Oh, okay. So, she just went straight from one to the other transferring. And what was her reason for leaving this program? The first one? The school, I mean, they have like 30 something thousand students. Now when she started MTS didn't have that many students. I, it just began. . She was overwhelming. Yeah. And you said she did receive supports? Yeah, MTSU she did. And can you tell me a little bit about the types of support she received? She received extended time on tests,  Okay. It's okay, I'll pause it. Okay. So, I have extended test time, preferred seating, extra time on assignments to class periods and flexible attendance. Yeah. Attendance and tardiness. I want to really get this right. It's some that the extra time on the assignments I had to fight for that one, the absenteeism I had to fight for that one. Oh, she had an accommodation, I had to do this. She had an accommodation for how now they do like E learn, like you do your stuff through the computer. Yeah. They would have to give her; she would not be able to use a syllabus. They have to give her dates on a calendar. And they would have to give explanation of the syllabus in detail form where she could understand it. Okay. And do you have any additional comments about this program? MTSU? And if not, that's fine. And we can move on to the next. Okay. And is she currently participating in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities? Sounds like she's really busy with all of her activities as it is. Okay. Great.\n",
            "finishShannon, do you feel that the job that you're currently doing is a good fit for you? Yes. Why is that? Why is this program a good fit for me? Why do you think that it's good for you? Because, It'll help me. It'll help you in terms of? Help me. Helped you, like organizing? Organizing and making goals, maybe. Making goals. Yeah. Do you like working with kids? Yes. You like working with kids. How many hours do you work here? I work from 5:50 AM in the morning until 4:00 PM Morning to 4:00 PM, every day? Yes. Every day. Okay. That's great. Do you happen to have any other employment since you left high school? Nope. This is the only one, the school district. It's the only one. Okay. Thank you.\n",
            "finishVisit, we set three annual goals with you. And the purpose of this goal development was to help you think about the goals that you really want to work on. So since it's been about a year, we'd love to know how you've been doing with these goals. But before we continue to discuss goal progress, we do feel it's important to say that we understand that a lot can happen in a year. And this past year was especially unpredictable. And we also understand that COVID might have made it harder to work on these goals. So all of that said the first goal was that you will eat snacks two times per day for five out of seven days of the week with the focus of this goal being how many times you eat snacks per day. So how have you been doing with this goal? I've been not doing good with it. Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . And would you like to tell me more? Yeah, I've been eating lots of junk. So how many times a day do you think you eat snacks? Would you guess? Three or four times a day. Okay. If you can think about the whole year, when you were doing your best with this goal, when you weren't eating as many snacks, how many would you guess you were eating when you were your best with it? I don't know. You don't know? Okay. No problem. Was there anything that made this goal harder to work on for you? No. Okay. And so the next goal was that you will take yoga classes once per week with the focus of this goal being how often you take yoga classes. I just started doing that at the Y. Oh, that's so exciting. How often do you take yoga classes? I do it every Tuesday. Every Tuesday? Mm-hmm . That's great. Yeah. And you recently started that? Yeah. Okay, awesome. And then the next one is within a year, you follow steps for taking a sexuality and relationships course. So steps could be like looking into what courses are available, reviewing resources with the family. Yeah, I've been looking. You've been looking? And then the last step would be taking a course. So where are you in that process? You said you've been looking? I don't know. I've been looking to take a class. Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . That's great. Have you found a class yet that you would like to take or have you looked at.. No. Okay. No, not yet. Okay, so now we are going to move on to talking about other questions related to goals.\n",
            "finish...activities that she's been involved in. So I know that we've touched on this a little bit, but I just wanted to confirm her school situation. So you mentioned that she has been out of the high school system for quite a few years now? Yes. Okay. So out of the school system. So I imagine then, since she graduated so long ago, that her high school track and plans have not changed since we last spoke. What year and month did she graduate high school? Or exit the school system? She graduated in 2012. Okay. And do you happen to remember the month? Yes, May. Okay. And do you remember the type of diploma that she received? She received a regular diploma, but she had received extended time to acquire that. Okay. So regular diploma with extended time. Okay. And so for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about some academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that she's been involved in since last January. But first, I'd like to get an idea of how she normally spends her time. So what does a typical week look like for Shannon? How has she been spending her time? Well, she works. She gets up for work. She walks her dog before leaving for work. After work, she does errands if she needs to do any errands on her way home. She walks her dog or does whatever necessary. Sometimes she, probably a couple times a week now that things have opened up a little bit, she goes to the Y. She goes to swim a couple times a week or walks with her dog. She occasionally gets together with friends before the COVID thing. Now she does a lot more social media and phone for keeping in touch with some friends that she does have. And so with her job at the school district, is she working independently or does she have some support at her job? She works as a school bus aide. So she is usually with a driver, occasionally with an additional aide if they're working with children with special needs or physical disabilities. So is she involved with a service like any sort of supported employment? No. Okay. And how many hours a week does she spend working? Approximately 30 to 35, depending on the week. It does change. And, And so has she been enrolled in any academic program at a school since January of 2020? I know that you mention that she... No, she hasn't. Okay. And so you said earlier in the interview that she has taken some classes at community college before, but not in the time since we last spoke? Right. Okay. And so, now I'll ask a bit about her job. She's working for pay independently and you said the school district. And you said that she is a school bus aide. Can you tell me a bit more about what she does there? Well, she helps children. Makes sure that they're seated, and now, of course with the COVID that they keep their masks on. She more time than that works on buses with children with physical disabilities or emotional disabilities. So in those cases, sometimes she has to monitor them and then make sure they're safe. And then she said that they can get from home to the school or from school to home safely. That's great. And so I already asked about this a little bit, but just wanted to confirm, does she receive any sort of supports while participating? You mentioned that there's sometimes another aide, but it sounds like there's, from what you mentioned, I just wanted to double check and see if there was anyone supporting Shannon directly. Not directly, no. Okay. And if she needs assistance, then she has to request assistance or asked to be helped. And, and is she paid at this activity? Pardon me? Is she paid at this job? Yes. And how did she find this job? She found that alone. She was seeking employment and she loved to be with children. So this is the job that she got. Well, I'm really glad that she could find something that she loves so much, that's awesome. And you said she works 30 to 35 hours per week. Do you remember the month and year that she started this job? 2019. 2019? And do you happen to remember the month? I believe it was in October. October? Okay. And do you think that this job has been a good fit for her skills and interests? So far, yes. And what has made it a good fit?  She does not have to work during the day at college and it is part-time. Okay. So just confirming you said it's a good fit because she likes working with children and it's part-time? Yes. The skillset that she needs for this is... It fits what she's capable of. Okay. And do you have any additional comments about this job or any circumstances that you'd like to explain? No. Okay. And has she participated in any other sort of job since the last time we spoke? I believe that the last time we spoke, you mentioned that she was working at Burger King? those Yes. She has worked retail and fast food franchises and usually prove to be too stressful and difficult for her. Was she working at any of those jobs since last January? No. No? Okay. So, just double checking, the only job that she has worked since last January has been the school district? That's correct. Okay. And so, is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other life updates that you'd like to share? I don't think so at this time. Okay, great. So I'll stop the recording.\n",
            "finishYou mentioned earlier that she is starting college next year, and that she's currently in high school still. And so did her graduation or high school track or plans change since the last time we spoke? No. And so when is she planning on exiting high school? Do you know the month and year? It'll be June is graduation. Oh, okay, great. So she's graduating this year. That's so exciting. And I think you mentioned earlier that she's not currently working and that she hasn't been working at any job since the last time we spoke as well. That's correct. And for the reasons that she's not working now, I imagine that she's focusing on school at this time. That is correct. And even without COVID, I don't think we would have her working. Mm-hmm . And has she been, and I know that there have been a lot of limitations to this because of COVID, but has she volunteered in the community since the last time we spoke? You said that was January was that we last spoke? Yes. So last year? Mm-hmm . I don't think she's done anything in the last year. Okay. Because most of the year has been COVID. Yes, definitely. But she has done some small community service stuff in the past, but I don't think we've done anything since then. And-  Since the last time we talked. Mm-hmm . Yeah. That was right before everything shut down. Mm-hmm . And so is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share? She's actually had a really good school year this year. That's great! So, and I think it's because she hasn't had to call social stressors and things that come with being around a lot of people. And so that's actually been a positive thing for her. It makes me a little nervous because she hasn't been, so she's not growing in that area, but overall she has asserted herself more. She does ask her teachers for help when she's struggling and she's shown a lot more independence this year than she ever has. So there have a lot of positives as a result of it all being virtual. That's great! So you said she's been more independent this year than she ever has? Mm-hmm . That's wonderful news! Okay. Well thank you so much. I think.\n",
            "finish...since the last time we spoke. But first I'd like to get an idea of how he normally spends his time. So what is the typical- .  Okay. ...week look like for him? How is he spending his time? He volunteers at the Nourish Food Bank, couple times a week. That's great. Mm-hmm . Okay, so volunteering in the community and does he do any other activities during the week-   Yes. ...or on weekends? He's taking guitar lessons. Oh, that sounds like so much fun. Yeah. And so how many hours a week does he spend volunteering, would you estimate? I would say 10 to 12. Okay. And so now I'll talk about some school programs that he's attended after high school. And I know that-  Uh-huh . ...he has not started Horizons yet, but he currently enrolled? At Horizons? Yes. Yes. Okay. And so you said it's called Horizons. And can you tell me a little bit about the program? It is a program for young adults on the autism spectrum to teach them independent living skills, budgeting, and the vocational skills. Great. And so will he be engaging and vocational activities as part of the program? Yes. Okay. And so, do you know what type of activities and whether that will be in the community or on campus? It will be, it'll be in the Birmingham community. Great. And do you know if he'll be getting paid? At some point he will be, yeah. Great. And will he be taking any classes with students without disabilities? Not at this time. Okay. And so what will his area of study be? If that question applies, or if it's just general independent living skills? It is, it's just general. Okay. General independent living skills. And so do you know if he takes like a certain number of classes or if it's more just like a daily kind of curriculum? Oh, they have it organized into classes. Oh, great. The classes are like your class is laundering, your class is cooking, that kind of thing. Yeah. Do you know about how many classes he'll be taking per semester? Per semester? I think there's five. Five? Okay. And so, I imagine he'll be a full-time student? Yes. And you said that he's starting that in September? September 9th. That, oh, that's so exciting. And will he be receiving supports from the program? Yes. Okay. And what kind of supports will he be receiving? If you can give me examples? I can tell you. Sure. So that could be like one-on-one support staff, or like extended time for assignments. Yeah, he'll have someone living on his hall that helps him and his autistic roommate learn the living skills and then at the school they definitely have one-on-one. Mm-hmm . Great. And- Teaching them to navigate transit, you know, public transit. And do you have any additional comments about the program or anything that you'd like to elaborate on? It's a godsend for young adults on the autism spectrum. I just wish we could figure out a way to help people. Because we've been told by the Administrators there that they've had students from Tennessee come and Voc Rehab had helped, but we haven't. We couldn't get Voc Rehab to respond to us. Mm-hmm . Well, I really hope that get back to you soon. Okay. And has he been enrolled in any other academic programs since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And so you mentioned that he's currently volunteering? Yes. And you said it was at Nourish Food Bank? Right. And can you describe the activity and what he does there? Second Harvest Food Bank sends a big truck and he and his fellow volunteers unload the truck. And then they sort the items into categories, like perishable or canned goods, hygiene products, that type of thing. Great. And does he receive any supports while participating? No. And is he paid at this activity? No. And how did he find this opportunity? Through our church. And how many hours per week does he do this? You said 10 to 12, generally? Yes. And what month and year did he start volunteering here? He started last year. So I'd say it's been about a year. Okay. So maybe around like August? Right. And do you think that this has been a good fit for his skills and interests? Absolutely. Great. And what makes it a good fit? He is extremely compassionate and he loves to help others. And so he fueled by that. That's wonderful. And do you have any other comments on this or anything that you would like to elaborate on? Nope. Okay. And has he participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke in January? Well, we do. We work the volunteer organization Room In The Inn, with the homeless. And that is through the church, and he does that. And that's a current activity that he does too? Yes. And what is that- Just monthly. Monthly, and what's that one called again? Room In The Inn. Room In The Inn. And you said that is through church and assisting people experiencing homelessness? Right? So organization, like our church basically helps the organization. The organization is in downtown Nashville and we take a group of homeless men every month and let them stay in our church for a weekend. And William's responsibility is he packs them all lunches, sack lunches to take with them when they leave that they have one meal for when they leave. Because we feed them of course the whole weekend. Oh, that's so sweet. That's very supportive. And so how many hours at a time does he participate in this activity? It's just a couple of hours every month. And I imagine he's not paid at this activity since it's a volunteer activity? No. And do you think that this is a good fit for his skills and interests? Yes, very much. And what makes it a good fit? Same reason, compassion. He loves to help people. Great. And is there, do you have any additional comments about this one? I don't think so. Okay. And has he participated in any other employment or vocational or volunteering activities, since the last time we spoke? He has not. Okay. And so now we'll switch gears again and we'll talk-\n",
            "finishShe’s still in high school. Has she ever worked during high school? No. And what about any volunteer activities? She has done some volunteering activities. And where were those? Through our church. Oh, okay. And could you tell me a bit about what she did? So we just did Stop Hunger Now last, two weekends ago, where we filled bags of food and she actually was able to do it the full three hours. It's the first time. Cause she hadn't been able to do it in the past because they play music, but her therapist was with us that time. So she was able to help me prepare Caroline and we got Caroline to do it and she did great. That's awesome. So she's done that. She's done... she usually helps out with the children's service at church and goes back with the young kids and the pastor helps with the kids. So I guess those are some examples. Oh, okay. And are those the only volunteering activities? It's all been through the church. Yeah. Okay, great. So that... But they also have done some stuff through Templeton Academy. Oh, okay. So like they built a bike school for the OASIS center, that school, so they are doing different activities at the school as well. There's a group of them and they've picked up litter and I don't know, I don't actually know everything they've done.\n",
            "finishOkay. And so you said he is still in high school, and he's in a program where he does school 3 days a week, and an internship three days a week? Correct. No, two days a week for the internship. Okay. 3 days a week for school. Okay. And internship 2 days a week. Okay, and have his high school, did his track or plans change since the last time we spoke in February, like deciding to graduate at a different time? No, he's going to graduate on time. Great. And when is he graduating? In May. Oh, that's exciting. It is. And so he's currently working at the internship, and is that the only job that he's holding right now? Yes. And does he receive payment at that job? No. Okay. And so that's- Full credit. At the church preschool, and it's a school internship. And how many hours a week does he work there again? Probably 6 to 10. 6 to 10. And when did he start this internship? He started his freshman year. So he's had it since his freshman year. Okay. Do you remember the month and year that he would've begun working there? September when he started, so four years ago. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about the job? I guess. It's a Spanish immersion preschool and so, before COVID, he would go in and participate with them in all of their little activities, set up the learning centers, and he's even taught their circle time, which is their daily subject that they learn about. And he just plays with them and sings with them, they sing Spanish songs and learn Spanish words. That's great. And since COVID, what exactly has he been doing? You said that he's managing their art projects? Yes, he's been assisting the art director, so he is assistant art director, and he just will prepare, for example, if they did this project that all these guitars needed to be cut out so that the kids could decorate the guitars, so he cut out all the guitars. And they did another clause with different shapes, and so he gave him a box of shapes that he had cut out and they made the collage with that. And right now he's prepping, he's actually going to be able to submit a lesson plan for Martin Luther king day. Oh that's awesome. And he put all that together for the teacher to teach. That's great. And does he receive support while working currently? Does he receive support? Mm-hmm . Well his supervisor helps him a lot, so yeah. Okay. And so what is his supervisor? Has the supervisor been able to still help while they're not on site? Yeah sending text, and FaceTime, and stuff. And so do you think that this job is a good fit for his skills and interests? I do yeah. And it sounds like it, but what are the reasons that you think it's a good fit for him? Well he loves children because he's childlike himself. And he has a trauma background, and so, when he was their age, he didn't have anyone to hug him and love him and stuff. So he is really trying to do that for them or that's what he's expressed to me. That's really sweet that he's doing that, I'm so glad that he found this opportunity. I know, me too. And has he worked and left any other jobs since February? No. And what about volunteering in the community since the last time we spoke aside from... Oh, yes, we... This preschool? Yeah. Through our church, we have a ministry to the homeless and right now that has increased because of COVID 19, the food insecurity. And so we still supply, we do socially distanced, we call them Saturday night suppers where the few food insecure can come and it's all outside and grab some dinner. And you said it was supper Saturday? It's called Saturday night supper. Saturday night supper. That's awesome that you're still doing that. Hmm . I think that's literally the only time we get out but that's important to us, we've done it for years. Great. And is there anything else that you'd like to share or any other updates that you'd like for us to note? I don't think so. The adoption was the biggest thing that's happened in our lives all year. Yeah, and that's really wonderful. Yeah. And so now I just would like to confirm your contact information. Sure. So what is the best email address for you? Nicole, N I C O L E, it's the same one that you guys email, so Nicole S Richland group.com and that's our.\n",
            "finishOkay great. So first I'm going to ask you just a few questions about school and work, and then we'll move on and I'll ask you some questions about some goals that we set, and then just a few general life questions. So first your mom told us that you are in a program called Horizons? Correct. Okay. And do you feel that this program is a good fit for you? Yes I do because I've never seen myself, in the future, living away from home, but Horizons will help me change that about myself, that I will live away from home. Wow that's great. Yeah. Start to live independently . Mm-hmm . Okay. So do you have any other comments that you'd like to tell us about Horizons, or anything that you'd like to explain or elaborate on? I'm starting in September. Okay. So I haven't been there yet. Oh, okay. Great, well that sounds exciting, sounds like fun. It is. So your mom also told us that you volunteer at a place called Nourish food bank? Yes. And do you feel like that volunteering experience is a good fit for you? Yes, because I love helping those less fortunate than me because it's just part of my personality, it's something I love to do. That's awesome. One second. And do you have any other comments about your volunteering that you want to share? No. Okay. Your mom also said that you volunteer at a place called Room in the Inn? Yes, it's where I... Oh, sorry. No, go ahead. It's where I go to pack  lunches for the homeless and bring it to with them at the church so they can have a nice sleep at the church and then they have something to take with them as they go. That's great. I'm so glad that you're able to do so much for the community. Yeah. And so do you feel like that experience is a good fit for you? Yes because we should all help our community out because that's what Tennessee is all about, they're all about helping everyone and yeah. Yeah couldn't agree more, that's great. Okay. So now that's all the questions about school and work or volunteering.\n",
            "finishOkay. And so William is still in high school? Yes. And has he ever worked during high school? He has an internship currently. Oh, that's awesome. He has for three years. Wow. And is this the only one that he's had during high school? Mm-hmm . Okay. And where is his internship? It's called El Jardin and that's E-L, second word J-A-R-D-I-N preschool. Oh, that's awesome. And so how did he find this job? They are housed within our church. And so we've always been aware of them. And it's a requirement with his school to have an internship in an area that you are interested in and Charly Care was a good one. Yeah, I imagine he's great at that. He is great at that. He seems so warm. And the kids love him. I bet. They call the days he comes, because he only comes on Tuesday or Thursday. They call them William days. Aw, That's so cute. And I that's great that his school requires that. That's amazing preparation. It's a different kind of school this school. They only go to school three days a week, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to do their coursework. And then on Tuesday, Thursday they do their internships. Wow. So that's awesome. What school is this or...? It's called Big Picture High School. It's in West Nashville. That's such a great model. I know. So how many hours a week on average does he do his internship? Probably eight. And you said he began three years ago. Do you happen to remember the month? It would've been September... September of his freshman year. Like maybe 4 years ago? Yeah. Wow. So he's been doing that for a while... Yeah. He's there. And so let's see. The next question is whether this job is at school or in the community, but it kind of sounds like it's a bit of both since it's a requirement through school or? It's through school, but the... Itself is in the community. It's in our community because we don't even live in West Nashville. We live in East Nashville. Oh I love east Nashville. I'm there all the time. It's a fun place. That's great. Okay. And so is this part of school programming then? It is. Okay. And can you tell me a bit about the job and what he does there? Sure. He's a teacher's assistant for a four year old class. And so he just helps like get their snack out and works with them at their different stations, mass station, drawing station, and he's actually led circle time a couple times, which is when he to plan that lesson and... Oh, Okay. And does he receive support while he's working? Meaning? Like from like a teacher or a peer from school or? Well, yeah, he's an assistant to a teacher there, so I mean... Or from like a teacher at his school though? Oh, well she checks on him like maybe once a quarter. Oh, okay. So she's not there in the classroom. Uh-uh. He's just there by himself. Yeah, he's there. And then she just comes and checks him with what is called his mentor which is his... the teacher's assistant, the teacher that he assists and then he gets his grade for his internship based on like what she says. Wow. And Do you think this is a good fit for William? Absolutely. That's what it sounds like. And so... 100% while we did that school. And what makes it... what else makes it a good fit for him? It's very close to our house and he enjoys being around little kids. So that's probably the main thing. Okay. And any other reasons why it's a really good fit for him... Compatible with his skill sets? Yeah, it's compatible with I mean... definitely. And he's just a very encouraging person, so he doesn't feel intimidated by children, whereas he does with teens. So he encourages them in everything they do. That's great. And has he volunteered in the community during high school? He does. Yes. We volunteer with Room In The Inn. Like what? It's called Room In The Inn. It's a homeless advocacy group. Like we make them lunches and they spend the night in our church once a month. Oh wow. And so what does he do for... For them in the inn? Yeah. He actually makes the homeless people's lunches that they... So that they can leave with a sack lunch. He makes their sack lunch. That's so that's great. Well, sounds like he's very busy doing some very important work. Yeah, we've done that... I did that for...we've done it for three years. That's awesome. Okay.\n",
            "finishOkay. Okay. So he is still in high school. You said that he's a junior. Yes. Taking virtual classes. Yes. Did his high school tracker date plans change, graduation date changed since the last time we spoke? No. So when is he planning on exiting high school? The month and year? He will exit high school in May next year. Okay. You said earlier that he is not currently working? Correct. Why is he not currently working? I'm assuming that just being in high school is one factor. Yeah, he's in high school and COVID. I mean, that is why. Yeah. Has he worked and left any jobs since we last spoke in February? No. What about volunteering in the community since the last time we spoke? No. Again, he would have... I would have had him... We had planned to volunteer at the Williamson County Animal Shelter. We had planned to do that last summer, but again, with COVID that was closed. They didn't let people volunteer. So we didn't do that. Is there anything else that you'd like to tell us or any other updates that you'd like to share? Even though he's virtual, he has a group of friends that he has a virtual lunch with on Fridays and he has a couple... I mean, he's really... Since last February, his friendship group, even with COVID happening, they've continued to stay in touch with each other without too much parental... They're doing that on their own, which has been really great. He is not obviously in any school clubs right now because his school clubs aren't meeting. So that's been a change as far as social activities for him. But overall, he seems pretty content to me. He doesn't seem... I mean, obviously the whole world is changed by what's happening, but I don't feel it's like affecting him more than it's affecting me or my husband or my daughter, if that makes sense. Well, that's great that he's still doing so well. It's wonderful to hear that. He really has... The transition to virtual was obviously upsetting at first to him. But once he got into the routine, he really has embraced it. He's advocating for himself as far as emailing his teachers. And the other day, the vice-principal emailed me and him. I had talked to her a couple weeks ago and said, \"You know, he is turning 18. I want you to communicate with him and just CC me and the letters.\" And so she had emailed him his schedule change, and I had seen it and I said something to him. I just said, \"Did you see your schedule change?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I did\". And I was like, \"Great\". And that was all I had said to him. He took it upon himself to email her back and say, \"Thanks for the change. Sincerely Michael.\" Totally followed up completely on his own without me even saying, \"Hey, you should let her know you found it or whatever\". So he's just really gotten good at advocating for himself through email, which I've been so proud of him for. And he follows a routine on his own, gets himself up in the morning, makes his own breakfast, reports to his classes on time. I don't have to do anything. Like he is 100% independent about managing his school right now. And it's just been great. It's just been really, really exciting to see that from him. And like I said, he made straight A's. So obviously he's doing okay. And just other things like he brings his laundry down on Sundays and makes sure that it's getting done. And yesterday he came downstairs and the dishwasher wasn't empty and so he just emptied it. I mean he did complain that it wasn't empty. And I said to him, \"Well, if you don't like the fact that it's not empty, you can always empty it yourself\". And so he just did. That's a dream. That's awesome. Yeah, I know. I was like, okay. Because he's like \"Mum, bowls are all in the dishwasher and they're clean. Why didn't you put them in the cabinet?\" And I'm like, \"Well if you want them in the cabinet put them in the cabinet\". So it's his lunch break and so he's like putting the dishes away before he makes his lunch and I'm just sitting there and I'm just watching. That's where, as a mother, you're like, \"Okay, I did all right\". That's awesome. It's hard to sit back and watch your kids. I don't know if you're a parent or not. I don't think you are. No. But as a parent, you always have to judge whether or not you get up and make his sandwich, or do you let him make his own sandwich? And so it's funny to just stand there and say... I was watching him make his lunch, but that's the great thing is that he is doing these things independently. So I do feel having a little bit of more time at home in some ways has made him better able to be self-sufficient because in the past he was always away from home. He was always at school or in therapy or whatever. And I just didn't have the time to work with him myself. So it's been kind of nice to have him home a little more and work on some of those life skills that we didn't have time to work on. That's great that he saved that opportunity. That's definitely silver lining. Yeah actually has been. It's been good. That part of it has been good. There are things that we are behind on, but there are things that we're able to capitalize on and do a better job with.\n",

            "finishAndres finished high school last year or two years ago? Last year. Yes. And has he ever worked during high school? No work. He was a volunteer in cafeteria. Okay. That was the school cafeteria? Mm-hmm . And he had made volunteering  and Food Bank to our school. Okay. Is that world market, or Walmart? It's a volunteer organization to feed people. Okay. And which one? You said food cafeteria? Foodbank. Foodbank, okay. Which one did he volunteer at for the longest time? When? No. Which one was he volunteering for the longest? The last one, it was in Foodbank. Okay. And what was he doing there? What type of activities was he doing, like helping out sort of thing? Yeah, he helping to set up the food, to serve the others and put the food in shelves. Awesome. And for how long did you say or around? Yeah, around it. Around how long? One week. One week? Only for one week? Yeah, one time for one week. Okay. One time, one week. So he only did it one day in one week, or one time every week? No, he do one time, one day. Okay. But then at the school cafeteria, was that something that... Every single day for two years. Oh, okay. And what was he doing there? Organize the snacks, the drinks, give drinks to the students. In  he helped make more volunteer over there, many days in different times. Okay. Awesome. And now, for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about everything that happened after high school, academic programs, jobs, and volunteering. But before we get into that, what does a typical week look like for Andres? What is his typical week like? It's very hard for him to understand. When you are giving to him direction, it's really hard for him concentrate, focus. When I show him, try to explain to him whatever task, he focus his eyes in different direction in what I try to explain to him. If I try to explain to him that he has to move this mouse, he's looking over there or another direction. And so that probably has a lot to do with how his week is organized and how you and the family is helping him? Yes, focus and concentrate and understand, deduce some situation. What does he do Monday through Friday? What is he doing? Basically, he's a student full-time. Full-time student. Mm-hmm . Okay. And at Next Steps. Mm-hmm . Okay. Is he doing any volunteering, any part-time job? Yeah. I mean, I try to keep him busy. I look in volunteer for him. Also, I remember last year, he was in one program in Goodwill. It was a training for three weeks. And the training, it was about cleaning, sweep, mop, clean tables. And that training, he was paid. He received payment for that. Okay. That was last year in summer. But now he's not volunteering or doing any type of paid training or internship? No. Just full-time student. And how many hours he in Next Steps total during the week? During the week, around 24, 26 hours. Okay. I mean, you're asking about the stay or in class or stay since he come in and he left? Anything? He's here. Anytime that he's involved, even if he's not in classes, but doing homework or working, at the library, studying. Yeah, 24, 26 hours out of day. And then so I know he's in Next Steps. Since finishing high school, was he only in Next Steps or was he in a different... Only Next Steps. Okay. That is Next Steps. And can you tell me a little bit about this program, the Next Step? Well, what I know is they is a program for 10 years, and the most important is to help people with some kind disabilities, to be available to do this thing by they self and be independence. So to get a job, keeping the job and live independent by their self. Sorry. No, no problem. And is he getting, Maurice, if you know, do you know if he would get any type of degree after finish? It's a four-year program? It's a four-year program, but I'm going to looking because I ask what kind certificate. It's a certificate. I have even from June. And he's in his second year now? Second semester. Second semester. He's freshman. Career and community studies. Mm-hmm . We call it CCS. Okay. Career and community studies certificate, CCS. What is the area of study? That would be career and community studies? Yeah. Mm-hmm . That is now diploma like. Yes. I see. And that's what it's focused on. What is the average number of classes that Andres takes first semester? In the first semester, it's 10 students. Okay. I am not sure if for second semester some students missing or not. I am not sure. But how many classes? Do you remember how many classes that Andres is taking? Class by class? One course, for example. It's one class daily or two class daily. Okay. Most of the times he's sharing time with ambassadors, counselors. So the classes that he has, for example, do you remember one class that he took? Sexual awareness. Okay. Sexual awareness and also... So how many of those did he take in the last semester? Five. Five. Oh, wow. That's a lot. I mean, believe me... It's impressive. My wife and me is speaking that, \"Hey, this is a regular career.\" And for me, especially for me, she's not too involved too much about this. It's me. I have to. And it's over helmet to me, especially because the technology crash to me is punch to me. He has a sexual awareness, food preparation and safety. Safety, steps toward employment. Steps toward employment, Next Step advising is when he speak with ambassador. And nutritional health, this is a real class. We call real class for another regular students. This is a typical class. Yes. Okay, awesome. When did he start Next Steps? Do you remember the month? August, last year. It is confused for us because call semester and it's only three semesters. I mean, I'm the same way. For me it's also confusing. But they will ask for six months. Is Andres receiving any support from the program, any support in an... Financial? Well, not financial, but more like, does he have extra time for completing homework or... Yes, with his ambassadors. I mean, it's hard to ask because the supports are built into it, so all the students are getting the support they need depending on what skills they have and what they may need help with. They are helping those along the way. I mean, this program is amazing. It's my hope about Andres. And I think there are not too much this kind programs in this country, because there is a lady, the mother of the other student, and they move from Chicago, I think so. And he was wait for me Chicago. Chicago is a big city. Why there are no a program like this in Chicago closer? And she has to move here, Nashville because the program for her daughter. So it's a selling program and they have every single students rather. He put ambassador and advisor, and then when they notice, in this case, Andres need assistance with some assignments or homework, so they let know to the ambassador. \"Hey, Andres is need this. He's late in this. He's behind in this.\" And then the ambassador, they help him in those subjects. So basically, they know more about Andres stuff than me. Wow. Is there anything else that you know about the program that you can think that he's getting support with as far as keeping track or anything else that he said like, they give me visuals instead of... I think so. They think about everything and this is a wonderful blessing plan in this area. And the program involved a really good companies around it. And there is a good change that they got a job after finish the program. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. Ms. Tammy, the director, she told me they have 92% capacity. Awesome. So that is wonderful. The program involve that, and the last semester Andres was in visiting companies like Nissan, banks, hospital, hotels. Wow, that's amazing. And those companies are involved with the program. That is a good opportunity that those company give the opportunity these guys for employment. That's awesome. I'm just making sure I don't lose track of my notes. That's great. We may ask Andrea some question about the program later when he gets here, and you said that's the only post high school program that he has attended. Mm-hmm . And then you said that he also volunteered after finishing high school? After finishing high school. So how many volunteering opportunities or activities was he involved in? I mean, he has been involved in three smart, in Foodbank sometimes, but sometimes a few times, he help his older brother Mondays nights to give food for homeless in downtown. That is what I remember. Okay. I'm going to ask you that the one helping his older brother, is that through any type of organization that has a name or do you know who organizes that? Well, three smart and Foodbank is, I don't know, it's not profit organization, but it's the only that I know, Foodbank. I'll start by asking you about Foodbank then, and then ask you some questions, specifics, and then we'll get to the other ones and see if that was something that happened like maybe a couple times or if it was something more consistent. But with Foodbank, how long has he been involved with them? Just one time. Okay one time. And he wasn't paid for that activity? And that one time, what did he do? What was that about? What he did? Mm-hmm . He had to put the food inside the container and help to serve the food, storage the food. I don't know what else he... No, that's perfect. And how did he find that volunteering activity? I did. And how did you find it? Online. Mm-hmm . And how many hours did he help that day, if you remember? Four hours. Okay. Do you remember when, around the month? That was last December. Okay. Do you remember the day in December? No. Okay. That was in the beginning of December. Okay. Great. And then you also said he also volunteered with three smart? Three smart. Is that something that he's doing every week or how often or one time or a few times? Yeah, once of the times. I mean, in two years, he had made volunteering in three smart for five or six times in one year. Let's say one year. One to six times. And what does he do or what did he do when he... He has to hang clothes, organize the shelf, pick up stuff from the floor or bring stuff from the back of the store. And he's not paid for that activity? No, he doesn't. Did he receive any supports when helping them out? A support could be a second person who was keeping track of Andres and that he wasn't spending too long on one activity, but that he remember to change after one hour, do something different or not ready. Well, be honest, I don't know, because I just drop off him. It's really hard for me to try to figure out how to help him more because I think so okay, I'm going to drop of him here in the parking garage. And in the way, he has to find out the store by his self, he introduce by his self. He say, \"Hey, this is Andres. I come here to volunteer.\" And I don't want to do that for him because I like that he does it. He got some try skills. Yeah, of course, to also know how to go. That is the idea. But yes, I think so. The stores and the Foodbank, both when I got the volunteer for him, I explain the people what's going on. So I think so, they help him with direction and spend more time with him, I think so, they do that. And how long was he there at each... You said he did it five or six times. So how many hours would he stay? Six hours. Six hours? Mm-hmm . Wow, that's a lot. Yes. Six hours. And do you remember the month or year? I mean, I guess it's not. It's really hard to remember when that happened. Yeah, because have been different months. When was the last time he did it, if you remember? Last December. December? Okay. And why did he stop doing that activity? Or maybe he hasn't. Maybe he'll do it again. Is there a reason why he stopped in December? Well, yeah, because I mean, I try don't put too much pressure on him. I let that he take some days relaxing. Okay. Perfect. But the idea is every opportunity he has days off like spring break or summer I'm going to set up for him more volunteers. Okay. Perfect. And any other volunteering activities that... No. Then you talked about a three-week training that he did last year? In Goodwill. In Goodwill. And where was that? Was that through school, through Next Steps, or was that... No. No. Okay. No, by me. Great. So I'm also going to talk about that or ask you a few things about that one. What was the training about, or how did you or Andres find that? It's a training. Basically it's a goodwill training for people, training people for got a job. My goal, it was that more that he got a job is that he got some skills. The training, it was everything about cleanup, mop, sweep, clean tables, throw away the trash, all that. He come back every day at home do it. I'm sure he was sorry though. Mama was not happy, but I was happy. Mama is protective. Yeah, all mamas. Mama protective. And he was paid for that activity. Yes, he was. And three weeks, how long each day? How long was he in the training each day? Eight hours. Wow. That's long day. Yeah. It was like a kind of regular job. It was like he was in a job, and I was really, really happy to get that program for him. That's awesome. In the end, I didn't care if he received the payment or no. My concern, it was, my goal was that he received the training. And does he currently, or I guess, who found that? Did you find it? Yes. Mm-hmm . And how did you, online also? Online. That's awesome. You're doing a great job and finding all of these activities for him. It's not easy for me, but I try. So he works Monday through Friday, 40 hours a week. Mm-hmm . And I mean, the idea was that to be a three week thing. Was there an option to stay, or how does that work? Was there an option to get a job in Goodwill after? So is that something that this time Andres is not doing because he's in school? No. He's in school. Oh, so is that over winter break? In summer. Over summer. Mm-hmm . Last summer. August or do you remember what month? July? That was in July. Okay. June or July. Okay. Let's see. And did he enjoy that, did Andres, or what did he think about the program? I think so he feel a little bit over  or something like that, but in the end, I mean, he followed it I assume. How I ask him, he followed it as you need it. Okay. Do you know if there were any supports in place for Andres to be able to follow the task? Mm-hmm . Yes. I mean the trainer, she did. So was that open to the community, anybody could sign up for that or was that a special supported... No, for everybody. Anybody could join. Awesome. And would the trainer stay with him the whole time, or would he do things by himself? Yes, all times. Oh, okay. But they explain to him the duration they stay with him, and then go back and leave alone. And so that trainer was from Goodwill, not from a disability agency? No, for everybody. Oh, that's great. . But when I called, I explained to them about Andres and they say no problem. He can go. Oh, that's great. That's amazing. Sounds like a great program . Yes, it is. Awesome. Any other job internship? Any type of training like this one where he was paid? No. No. Awesome. So then that's the last question for this one. It's five minutes to 3:00. Do you think that we can keep on going or do you want to stop and get Andres and then come back? Wait. This is the last question, you say? This is the last question for this part of the study. We have more questions. Let's do the last question. Oh, we did the last question. Ah, okay. Okay. I go quickly to... Okay. Okay. So we'll stop this and then we'll...\n",
            "finishOkay, so you've said that she is enrolled in high school and taking classes virtually. Did her high school graduation plans change since the last time we spoke? Did her what now? Did her graduation plans change since the last time we spoke? Well, no she doesn't graduate until next year. Okay.  She's not graduating till next year.  So when will she graduate? In two years. Okay.  so she'll graduate in 2022.  Mm-hmm  and you said earlier that she is not currently working, and that she hasn't worked since the last time we spoke either, correct? I did, that is correct. She hasn't worked at all. I wanted to get her . Sir, I couldn't quite hear the last part of what you said but from what I heard, you said that you're working on getting her a mentor?  has a work coach. Oh, a job coach okay. Work coach, that's what you're all saving . I think she could use one for a little while, I don't think forever, but just for a while. Mm-hmm . And also I just wanted to confirm earlier, you mentioned about researching vocational rehabilitation. Did you start to apply for it or were you in the process more of researching it? I started to apply for it. Oh okay, thank you so much. I will make sure to write that down. Okay and so, has she has been able to volunteer in the community, since- No. ... COVID? No, no. Yeah. I imagine not. Okay, and that's actually the last set of questions, but is there anything else that you would like to tell us, or any other updates that you would like to share? No.  get everything. Okay. I mean, we're not do anything right now. Those plans and things that we had before COVID, they're on hold. So, we're being provided with the service, but if there's anything you all can help out with as far as vocational rehab and her working, we getting her into the work force with a coaching partner, that would be great. Mm-hmm . I definitely want to make sure I write that down. One moment. Yeah, I will definitely talk to my team and see if that's something that we could maybe provide advice about. \n",
            "finishSo regarding his high school status, so is he still currently receiving, is this a high school program that he's involved in? I wouldn't call it a high school program, no. They basically have an IEP based on his ability, educational ability and intellectual ability. So I wouldn't call it a high school program, no. But technically he would be one year out of high school. He would've already \"graduated\" from high school at his age. And so is this program through the school system? Yes, it is. Okay. Because technically he could be in school until he is 22. And so he has that same eligibility in this program as well. Okay. And so did his school or residential school plans or track change at all since we last spoke? Track change? Yeah. Like, is he staying in longer than maybe you expected or is he planning on maybe leaving sooner than you expected initially? Any changes like that? There's been no change to his status now. Okay. But we personally are looking at potentially making a change, but that's not due to his eligibility. Okay. And so when is he, at this time, planning on exiting this program or exiting the school system? We don't know. It's too soon to know. So I will make a note of that. And you said he is eligible until he is 22? That's correct. Okay. And so that means that he could stay potentially enrolled for about four more years? Yeah, he's coming up on 19. So probably more like three more years. Okay. And let's see, I believe that since he is not currently working and has not been working since the last time we spoke as well, that this might be the end of our interview, but I just wanted to double check one thing. Has he volunteered at all since we last spoke last January? He's just really not able. His skills and ability are just not where that would be a possibility for him. And I imagine with all of the limited opportunities due to COVID, that would've been really tough to do in a year like that. Okay. Well, is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share? I don't think so, no. Okay. Great. Well, thank you so much.\n",
            "finishSo he is enrolled in a transition program at this time. Correct? Have his plans or track for completing this program changed since the last time we spoke last February? No. Okay. So when is he planning on exiting this program? He is eligible to stay in this program until the end of the school year. I'm trying to think. So the year that he turns 22, he can still complete the program. So after the school year, he can still go for two more years. The tentative plan was for him to switch to a more intensive job program during the last year. So that might be considered a program change. That would be 18 months around, or maybe 16 months until he might go into that last phase. It sounds like he's eligible to stay in the school system in two years? I think that's true. You would anticipate him leaving the school system around May? Perhaps. Okay. I think it's possible that he could get a job offer during his last year, and I don't know at what point that would come. If he did that, he might exit if he's ready, but I think he's eligible to stay to the point that you said. Just to confirm he is not currently working and he is not been working during COVID-19. That's correct. Okay. The barriers have been, he's not able to go to job sites through his program right now? And then that Goodwill program was closed this year? Yeah. Okay. I think that covers the questions that we have for today. Is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share? I can't think of anything. Okay. Sorry, I forgot one last question. Has he volunteered in the community since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. Well, thank you so much now I'm just\n",
            "finishHis typical week consists of going to his work program, doing chores at home, he spends some time with me and some time with his dad. He also spends some time with other family members, my sister, my mother recently passed away, Oh sorry. But he spent... Thank you. He would visit her every day. He sometimes takes voice lessons. We're taking a break for them right now. Oh, like singing? Yeah. That's so fun. So we're taking a break. We've only been a break from them for about a week. He was on them for about a year before that. We go to church every week generally and he'll go down to Sunday School class with the youth group, but he doesn't usually do a whole lot outside. And for his work program, does he get paid at this program? He doesn't get paid. So it's more of like a training program? Training program. And let's see, how many hours do you think during the week he works at this program? I think 8 to 10. 8 to 10 per week. Okay. And has he been enrolled in any academic program since high school? I imagine not because it sounds like he started the work program pretty soon. Yeah, started the work program. They do a little bit on the academic side. I think they read, I think they read books in a group and kind of... So they do a little bit with practical math, a little bit with reading comprehension, but that's about. It's more life skills. Okay. And so he is currently participating in this program and it, sorry, I keep forgetting the name of it. I know he told me a few times what it was called. Home Community-Based Transition Program. Home community-based- No, no. Oh, sorry. Community-based transition program. Community-based transition program. And could you describe this program a bit and like maybe the types of supports he receives while participating. Okay. So it's through  schools so he rides a school bus there. They work there approximately two hours a day and they have job coaches. And they go to four or five different sites that they go to to do different type of work. They do some computer lab things. They have community lunches once a month where they're basically learning how to go to do a restaurant and do those kinds of things. They do certain life skills things, they might go shopping and price some things, they might go somewhere as a group and you know... Yeah, that sounds great. And he was saying that he goes to the library That is one of the places where he works. He works at the library. I think he also said  and a university? . They go to Trevecca which I think he does cleaning and dish washing in Trevecca. He was saying earlier that he might want to, when he graduates, work in a library. And how did you find this activity? This was choice for him when he graduated from high school because he can stay in public school until he's 21. So this is a choice that his teachers suggested might work for him. And you said he normally participates in this activity. So he works at the sites for maybe 8 to 10 hours. How many hours do you think he participates in the whole activity? It's like a regular school day, which I think there are seven hours. So is it like 35 hours? Yes. So like 35 hours. Wow. He's got a very full schedule. And I think you said he started in August? Yeah, it runs with the school year, really. That's great. And do you have any additional comments about this program? Well, they are very conscious, they ask for parents input, they're very conscious of just the kinds of life skills that he needs to be learning. I'm very positive about the program. Okay, great. And has he participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since leaving high school? No. Okay. Perfect.\n",
            "finishYout mom was telling me about your work program. What was that program called again? Cone Learning Center. Cone Learning Center. Yeah. So let's see.

And what are your favorite parts about working there? Going to the library. So is it a good fit because they take you to places that you like to go? Yes. And do you have anything else that you'd like to say about this program? No, I think that's it. Yeah. And you also like your teachers a lot too, right? I do. I think you were saying that earlier.

So, she graduated high school and left the school system? Yes. Okay. Did her graduation plans change since the last time we spoke at all? No. Okay, and what year and month did she graduate? Oh, gosh. She graduated high school, I can't even remember the year. She was 18, it's been a while. She's been out of school for a while. Mm-hmm . Let's see. So, she was 18- It'd been May of the year she turned 18. Okay, and do you remember the type of diploma that she received? Actually, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, she was 19. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. No problem. Do you remember the type of diploma that she received? Well, it was a regular high school diploma from HomeLife Academy. Okay. So now for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about things like academic programs or employment or volunteering activities that she's been involved in since we last spoke, but first I'd like to get an idea of how she normally spends her time. So, what does a typical week normally look like for Bea and how has she been spending her time? Since the last time we spoke? Mm-hmm . Just in her room playing games. She's done some storyboards and working on her hygiene. Of course taking care of her dog, nothing really different. Because of the pandemic, she wasn't able to do all the other stuff that she wanted to do, like playing basketball and going to school, none of that. So, kind of just the pretty boring staying at home doing nothing, playing on her video games. Yeah, and it sounds like that's been really common for a lot of people. So, earlier you mentioned that she's not been involved in an academic program since COVID kind of halted that process a little bit. Right, that's correct. Mm-hmm . So, earlier I think you mentioned that she'd been planning on maybe going to school this year. Is that correct? Yeah, she had planned on going to school, at least taking some classes for making video games and that sort of thing, but it's just not in the cards at the moment. Mm-hmm . You said that that's due to  Employment's not anything she's looking for. She'd rather be self-employed doing computers at home. Mm-hmm . You said she'd rather be self-employed doing computers at home? Yes. Okay. Making video games and something like that. Earlier you said too that there has not been a change in her employment status since the last time we spoke. That's correct, she's never worked. Okay, and so is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you want to share? We don't really have any updates. Like I said, I'm hoping to get the house by the end of the year and hopefully next year really vamp her up to get her where she can go to school or find a way to make money online. Just something that engages her, instead of just sitting playing video games. Yeah. Well, thank you so much. I think that that's all-\n",
            "finishWe'll start by talking about employment and volunteering activities that he's been involved in during high school. So, just I'm confirming, he's still in high school? Yes. Has he ever worked during high school? No. Has he ever volunteered during high school? With the youth group. Do you remember where he volunteered? He has done summer camps. He's spent a week in Mississippi helping the neighborhood as part of a youth camp. They were painting and weeding and things around to help the local neighborhood. Oh, that's really nice. He also did that a week in Tennessee, again with the youth group for a week. They go to local, the food bank, and help them, and then the next day they'll go help a homeless shelter. Then the next day they'll go help another non-profit around Murfreesboro area. That's great. That's awesome. He's done that for a week, and then he's also... One day they'll just go and help babysit, and hang out with the people at a women's shelter one night. Wow. Or sometimes they'll go and help the food bank one night, things like that. That sounds like a great program. Does he enjoy it? Yeah. Awesome.\n",
            "finishOkay. Okay. And so just confirming that he has graduated high school and so did he, you said he's exited the school system since the last time we spoke in January. And so when did he leave high school? May 17th is, was his graduation day. Oh, that's so exciting. And, And so then for this section, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's attended since the last time we spoke in January, but first I'd like to get an idea of how he normally spends his time. So what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? This summer? Since, since he graduated high school, he has been taking a college class in online to help get prepared for the full load he'll be taking in the fall. So he's taking one class and kind of hanging out and relaxing in the summer when he's not, when he's not doing that class. And is this class that he's taking, is this part of his enrollment in school? Yes, he's, he's enrolled in one like English 101 class. Okay. And, and how many total hours does he spend participating in this class per week? Well, it's three hours of lecture. And then, you know, maybe five hours a week of follow up, you know. He has to write essays, that's part of the class so. Okay. And, and so he's currently enrolled in school, so I'd like to know about the school that he's enrolled in. So what's the name of the school or program? The school is Chattanooga State Community College. Great. And can you tell me a little bit about this program? It it's just a, an English class and the reason it was he's taking it is because this fall he's going to be going to the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga and there autism program, it's called Mosaic, and their program recommended he take this class as a introduction to college classes to get better prepared for the fall. And what was the name? The one he'll be in the fall again? So Mosaic is the name of the autism support program at the University of Tennessee in Chattanooga. Okay. And that's what he'll be in the fall? So Mosaic is teaching, is giving a class also that the PR funded class, that's the, that he's also doing that this summer and that's just one hour a week. And that's, that's talking with the Mosaic staff about, you know, how to prepare for college and how to communication skills and social skills and things like that. And so right now, the class that he's taking, I'm assuming that's not an autism or disability specific program? It, it is, it is. Yeah. You have to be in and have autism in order to be in the Mosaic program. Oh, I mean, for the,  That that's the, oh yeah, the, no, the English class is just a regular English class.  Okay. But, but it's, well, it's not, it's, it is a regular English class and they decided to get people from Mosaic and other people that need a little help getting ready for the fall to join that class. Okay. So it happens to have like a lot of people from Mosaic, but it's not specifically for them. Yes. Okay, great. Thank you so much for clarifying. And so I'm assuming then that would qualify as, so he's just taking that one class right now, English 101 to prepare for Mosaic. And so I imagine then he would, that would be considered right now kind of part-time since he's just taking that one course at, yes. Okay. And when did he start taking this? The beginning of June. Okay. Beginning of June, June 1st, I believe is. Okay. And is he receiving any supports from Chattanooga State Community College? Hmm, let's see. I think that he, he could. I remember filling out a form with them. I don't think he is. Yeah. He's, he's got accommodations with them, but I don't remember what they are and if, if he has some, I mean, he's not really using them, he's just, just listening to the class and writing essays and that's all. And do you think that  He, but, but they do have accommodations if he ever needs them, but I don't remember exactly what they are. Right. I guess like the being able to write notes and having the lecture play back, those are available to him I believe through Chattanooga State maybe is. And do you think that he Doesn't need the, Do you think that this Chattanooga State class has been a good fit for him? I think so. Yeah. Great. And what's made it a good fit. He says he likes the teacher, likes the material. That's great. And do you have any additional comments about this program? Well, it was hard to get started because it was brand new, so it was a lot of paperwork at first and he wasn't registered as early as he was supposed to be, so I had to get involved and help him register and do some of the paperwork part. But now that that's done, everything's going smoothly. Well, I'm glad to hear it's going smoothly. And, and so is he currently enrolled in the Mosaic program? Just hasn't started yet? Yes. He, he will start that in, well, the, yeah, he's taking a class this summer, so yeah, I guess he's, he's enrolled in Mosaic now. Okay. And that's yeah. And he's The Mosaic program at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga? Correct. Okay. At Chattanooga. And will he be degree seeking? Yes. Okay. And, and can you tell me just, and I know you've already told me a little bit, but can you tell me a little bit more about this program? Since last time we kind of focused on the online class that he was taking, but now I want to know a little bit more about the Mosaic program itself. Okay. So Mosaic supports degree seeking students with an autism diagnosis. They give them weekly mentors to talk with. They have like a peer mentor every week that helps them with peer issues. And then they have a academic mentor they meet with weekly to go over their academic goals. They have social gatherings, or they encourage them to go do other social things, but they also get together as a Mosaic group and do things together. And they help them deal with the disability office, if there's accommodations they need. And they, one of the accommodations that it's usually given is having your own room in the residence hall. That sounds like a great program. Yeah. So it's, they, they, and they also will help meet with roommates or professors, or, you know, anybody who the student is having a hard time communicating with Mosaic will step in and help with the understanding of what's needed to help the student succeed. And, Oh, they also have like four hours where you have to do your homework observed by Mosaic staff. So they, they monitor that to make sure that you're, you're doing, what's required to, to yeah, have academic success. That's great. And I know that you said that he's going to be starting it in the fall, but are you able to gauge yet whether this program is a good fit and if not, that's okay. I think it is now. It sounded, sounds good. There there's other programs and other colleges that we looked at also, and this was, was one of the best. So we're glad we, that he, that he got in and looking forward to him being a part of it. It's the parent isn't really involved at, at all, it, they build a relationship with the student. So I don't, I'm not going to be able to judge the details, but it sounds like a really good program from, from what I understand. And so he'll start taking classes on campus in the fall. So is that, will that be next month in August? It will be in August. Yes. August 16th is when classes start. He will also have a, the class he's taking this summer is just kind of a class in the fall. He will take a similar kind of class for college credits, so that, and that will be more structured and have some homework and all it's about how to, like the first year they focus on, you know, what is autism and, you know, what are your strengths and your weaknesses, and, you know, how are you going to make it through college? You know, what do you need and how to speak up for yourself? And then as you go through the years, you know, like year four is more focused on how do you get a job after college and things like that. But. So that college credit class is helping them learn about autism, learn about advocacy, learn about job opportunities and different things. That's wonderful. That sounds like such a great program. I'm so happy to hear about that. And, and it sounds like he's been involved in a lot of programs since graduating high school. So I'm assuming that he's not been involved in any other academic program besides those two, since we last spoke. Right. Okay. And, and is he, has he participated in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke in January? No. Okay. And Okay. And now we'll switch gears again and we'll talk about some, talk about the goals that we set with him last.\n",
            "finishSo first, could you describe his high school situation? He's currently a senior in high school. And did his high school track or plans or graduation date planned graduation date changed since the last time we spoke last January? They currently don't have a date. They're they're going to get that information to us at a later time. So they had a plan and it's up in the air right now. And so the next question was about when he's planning on exiting high school, but you said that they don't have a date right now, but that they'll notify you soon? Yeah. I mean, you, he will graduate this May. Oh, okay. But that they don't know the date of the ceremony. Oh, okay. Sorry. I misunderstood and thought you meant that they weren't quite sure when he would be graduating like monthly. Yeah, no, no, he, yeah, he will. He will definitely be graduating in May. They don't know if there's going to be his ceremony or if so, when, but.. And  Yeah, he'll be, he'll be finished in May. And did that change at all since the last time we spoke or was he planning before to graduate this May? Yeah, that was the original plan. Oh, okay. And so is he, it sounds like earlier, you mentioned since he's waiting on VR services that he's not currently working. So is he currently working? I'm assuming since you're waiting on VR that he wouldn't be, but I just wanted to ask just in case. Yeah. He's not currently working. Okay. And the reason is waiting for VR services to start. And has he worked and left any jobs since we last spoke in January? No. And what about volunteering in the community since the last time we spoke? Due to COVID, he has not. He, he would have, but those opportunities got canceled. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any updates that you want to share with us? No. Okay. Well, thank you. So.\n",
            "finishComplete a survey. Is that time if he completes a short survey. Okay. I'll see you guys soon. And the idea is 1,007. Yes. Okay. Just making sure. Thank you. Okay. Sorry, just taking a moment to pull it up. Let's see, where is this one? Okay. So we'll first talk about employment and volunteering activities that Gordon was involved in during high school. Okay. So he's not still in high school. And did he work in high school? No. No. And did he volunteer in the community during high school? I think he did some things with the youth group. And then of course, when he did one day at that . Sorry, I'll just grab this one. Which computer... Are you guys fine.? We're good. Perfect. Thank you. So if he volunteered a bit with the youth group and then had a date habitat for humanity. Mm-hmm . Okay, great. And so for the rest of the interview, I'm just going to ask about academic programs and employment and volunteering activities that he did after high school. So first I'd like to have a general idea of how he normally spends his time. So we'll talk about activities that he participates in during a typical week. So I'm guessing since he's about to go back to school, we'd probably look at a typical school week. Okay. If that's where he spends most of his time now. So what does a typical week look like for Gordon, and how has he been spending his time? I'm just going to think back to last semester of what I know. So he would have whatever classes during the day, and then he takes really long showers and he takes really long food breaks. So, we had to sit and make a schedule of this is your shower time, or this is hour to eat or whatever. So he'd have his classes. And sometimes he would go to study hall. Sometimes his GA would meet him at the library and they would study one on one. He did tutoring and he would meet with his team At least once a week. And we had other built-ins to the time. I don't know what he actually did, but... Can be hard knowing from... From a long distance. I'm sure my parents didn't necessarily know what I was up to at the college. I think he spends a lot of late nights on the computer. Okay. And so it sounds like mostly he's been involved in his post-secondary education program, so he's not working currently? No, well, he stopped working when he went back to school. Okay. He started there. Yeah. And we were hoping he would get some hours over break. And so how many total hours during an average week does he normally spend in school? In school? So I think like last semester he had 12 credit hours and this semester we've requested that he come down to nine. Okay. And how many hours do you think he spends in class and then also studying per week? Okay. So in class . So it sounds like he'd be doing nine per credit hours. And then how many hours do you think he might spend studying outside of the classroom? So it'll depend, I think, on what classes he gets this semester and also the classes, because it'll change when he goes back, but if he has a class that has a lot of writing, it's going to take him longer because he has such a hard time getting his thoughts down. And so Knowing him, he will avoid a lot last minute. Familiar with that. Just that it drives me crazy. I'm sure. Because now like last semester, one of his classes had a lot of like he had to do journaling and so what he would do is he would work with his GA. He would verbalize to her what he wanted to say and she would type that and then he would go back and edit it to turn in. Because he's not answering any of your questions? No, that's okay. So he's probably spent nine hours in class and if he does tutoring, I think he was only doing tutoring once or twice a week. And do you know how long the tutoring sessions generally is? An hour. An hour, so I'll say maybe two hours. Tutoring and we're hoping he'll spend more time in the writing center. So I would say maybe a couple of hours. Okay, great. And so now we'll talk about the school programs that he attended after high school. And so he's currently enrolled. So we're going to talk about all the school programs he's attended beginning with the most recent one and working back to when he left high school. Okay. This current one is Marshall University. And can you tell me a little bit about this program? The first two years and he's in his first year there, they do all of his advocating for him. And then after that, they will teach him how to do that. But he meets with them weekly. They give him his schedule every week And talk with his teachers and they'll call me if they have questions or other things they need help with. They will make sure he is up in time for class. And it's a new class and his GA usually come with him the first time. And what is GA? His graduate assistant. Graduate assistant. Great. And what type of degree or certificate do you think he's on track to complete? He is working on getting his bachelors, he'd like to get his PhD. Oh, That's great. He's studying physics. Sorry. That's very impressive. Oh my God. So last semester without studying physics, you got a C and I'm like, \"just look what you could do  study.\" That's really impressive for not studying, especially.  study. So working towards a BA in physics. And then are his classes with other people in his program or are they generally with more of this general student body? It's the general student body. But Marshall has... Everybody on campus knows about this program. So all those students are educated  Which is great. Yeah. It sounds wonderful. Let's see. And you said he's doing physics and takes nine to 12 credit hours. So that's three to four classes. Mm-hmm . I'm assuming. And is he currently a full-time student then? Mm-hmm . And do you remember the month and year that he started this program? Well, he's actually started there last summer. So end of June or July last year? It was July, I think. So July. Mm-hmm . Okay. And it sounds like he does receive a lot of support. You've told me a little bit about what the GA does. So graduate assistant will help him plan his schedule. Right. And I think she also works with the teachers too, and to make sure what assignments he needs or what assignments he has coming up so that she can help him kind of plan that as well. She's his tutor as well? No. So he goes tutoring? No, he went to tutoring for calculus. So that was separate. And was that through the program? Or was that just... At the school. And it sounds like he takes classes that aren't necessarily modified for people who need accommodations. It sounds like he takes general education classes there. What do you mean? At these programs, they have modified classes specifically for people who might need accommodations. But it sounds like he takes typical classes. Right. Do you have any additional comments about this program? If so, feel free to elaborate, but if not, we can move on. I can just say that they've been a blessing because after the time that he was going to school without our program was really tough because nobody would talk to me. I imagine.  for him at the school. If he's late on an assignment, they'll talk with his teachers and see if he can have extended time. So they've been really wonderful. That's great. Yeah. That sounds like a fantastic program. I'm really glad that you found it. And so it sounds like he has been involved in other school programs after high school. What was the name of the one that he attended before Marshall? So he actually went to three. Okay. So the one right before Marshall ? Right before Marshall was Ball State and he just did online classes. Okay. And as that a four-year university online? Ball State is two. Two years. I believe. So he's been working on this degree since he graduated 4 years ago. Okay. As smart as he is, he's been on academic suspension because he hasn't had the support until now that he's needed. Well, it sounds like with the supports, he can really thrive. So like his GPA went from like a 0.26 going into Marshall that now is a 2.1. Wow. He really brought that up. Yeah. Oh my God. After one semester with support so or two summer semesters. And so can you tell me a little bit about this program at Ball State? So Ball State, he just took a couple of classes trying to get a couple of classes out the way, but again, he didn't have any supports and online if he had questions he didn't know who to go to ask for help. So online was not really a good option for him. And was this also in physics? Mm-hmm . I could not imagine taking physics online. Oh my God. So do you remember how many classes he was taking per semester? So I think that semester, he just took physics and calculus too. Took two. And so was he a part-time student then? Mm-hmm . And do you remember the month and year that he started? January. 2018? '19. He's supposed to. And he's not currently enrolled and it sounds like he didn't receive support. So do you remember the month and year he decided that it wasn't a good fit and decided to leave? It would've probably been like December and he wouldn't have left, I don't think, but he had  I have to think. It was Nashville. I'm thinking of Nashville State. I'm sorry. So in the process of that, he had applied at Marshall. Okay. Because the school before that was the other school in . I've driven past it. I know which one you're talking about. Because he went there. I don't remember the name of that one. I always pass it when I go to target. So do you estimate that maybe he left June then the Ball State? It has to be a semester ended in May. And you said he chose to leave the program. And just to describe the circumstances of his departure, going off of what you said, it sounds like he just wasn't receiving supports. Right. Can you think of any other reasons he decided to leave? Oh, and also he got accepted to Marshall. And was he not receiving supports be because they weren't available or were they available and he just maybe wasn't you using them. I think that what he had asked for was extra time  and being online and he doesn't drive. If I was at work, he didn't have a way to get there. And so I think he didn't know. We would try to figure out who he would need to talk to, but he's also good at picking up the phone and calling somebody, and asking for help. So did they generally help him by giving him extra time or not necessarily? Yeah, but that was pretty much the only foundation that we had since he was online. He didn't communicate with his . Okay. And so the program before that was Nashville State. And was this a two-year program or four? It was also a two-year program. He actually only did two semesters there though. Okay. Could you tell me a little bit about this program? He was studying physics and I think the only accommodations he had again were extra time. And I know one class he like completely missed the final. Oh no. His mother was not happy. So he did a semester there from, I guess, August to December. Okay. August to December. And then he took a semester off because that was when his dad died. Okay. And then he went back in the summer. So was that June? No, maybe May. I think they started in May. So he went back May through August taking one class and then August to December he went full-time. Let's see. August to December. So he started August, and then took a semester off. So when did he finally officially leave the program? December, 2018. December, 2018. Got it. And was he also studying physics here? You said I can. And he started off part-time then went to full-time you said. No, he went full-time that first semester. And then part-time. And then part-time and then full-time again. Part-time. So just for the summer, he took one course, the other two semesters he went full-time. So, the average number of classes he was taking per semester then. It's probably four. Four? Yeah. Okay. Let's see. And was this program... It sounds like it was inclusive. So he was with people in typical classroom settings and he wasn't really getting any supports. Right. So he did get better there about talking to his instructors and his advisor. But I think still again, supports were just extra time at tests. He did talk to one instructor at the end of the semester and he asked if he could go take extra time to write his papers. So the instructor had given him a month, but he never did do. And his physics instructor at that time had said, and she was his advisor and said, you need to look at taking fewer classes, which was the plan for the next semester. But then He was on academic suspension. Okay. And so he chose to leave the program and when he decided to officially leave the program, can you just describe those circumstances when it came down to it in December of 2018 when he left officially? And that was because of the suspension. Yeah. And at that point, he knew he needed to do something. Obviously, he wants to continue to learn. I've never seen anybody. I'm telling you, he took calculus one, five times and I'm like, I don't know anybody else on the planet who . Who would put themselves through that? Calculus was hard enough when I took it once That's a lot. That's really impressive. He's determined. And that's what I wish the schools would look at is his determination. Because right now at Marshall, he came in on academic probation, which we didn't know. And so since he didn't get a 2.0 this semester, he had to reapply and say, this is what I'm going to do to bring my grade up. So. Oh, okay. So, if he doesn't get a 2.0 this semester, then he's on suspension. So when he entered this program this semester at Marshall, he was on probation. And then they talked with him about a plan. Well, but that's the thing, we didn't know until close to the end of the semester because they didn't tell his team. So his team didn't know and I didn't know. But then they made a plan with him. Yes. Now he has the plan and he'll actually go in on Monday and Meet with his team and the Dean. . That sounds like a great support system right there. He had people backing him up, which was great because... Well they know how much he wants to learn, it sounds like. Yeah. And so you said there was one more program. So, before that, he did Tennessee Tech in Cookeville. What kind of program? It's a four-year college and that is studying business. And let's see, do you know the average number of classes he was taking per semester? That was full-time. I'm thinking he had like 12 to 13 hours. . So that's like... He had... Four to five classes. Yeah. Wow. I can see why that would be overwhelming. Yeah. And we didn't know anything. So, their disability services didn't work with them a lot. Disability services... What I know it doesn't have a lot of services. So I think he's only again, gotten extra time on his tests. And he really liked that school, but that's where he really wanted to go back to, but without supports, he couldn't. He had teachers who wanted to work with him, but it wasn't in him to go to a teacher and try to talk to them and try to get help. And so, that was just a barrier for him. And do you remember the month and year that he started that program? So that would've been August. And when did he depart? May, next year. And what was his reason for leaving? And that was academic suspension. And you said that it was because he didn't receive very many supports. Didn't have support and he didn't know, especially being so far from home, he didn't know where to go and who to talk to  needed help. If I would try to call, then he would just say, we can't talk to you which is really frustrating. Because you're trying to do everything you can and they probably will use a routine. So were the supports available, but you'd say he wasn't using them or was it more of a situation of they just... Because you said they did have a disability services. They did have disability services. All of these schools have had disability services and I don't know that if he didn't know what to ask for or if he felt like that was the only thing he needed to ask for because Nashville State was wonderful. Because when we went in, they were like, if you need anything just ask for help but I'm sure . Okay. I'm just going to make a quick note up here. Okay. And now we'll talk about his employment and vocational and volunteering activities since leaving high school. So can you tell me about the jobs or programs beginning with the current or most recent job? Most recent would be cook at Battered & Fried. Okay. Battered & Fried. Which is now Boston Commons, I guess. And can you describe this kind of job? So did I say cook? I'm sorry, no, He was a dishwasher. I don't know why I said he was a cook, but no, he was a dishwasher for the restaurant. Okay. And did he receive support while working? I don't know. They were all aware of his diagnosis and so they understood that sometimes he was  they would encourage him. Okay. And I'm assuming he was paid at this activity? I hope he was. And let's see, this was... And how did he find this job? Actually, his dad was friends with the owner, they got an interview set up with one of the manager of that one. His friend owned several businesses there, several restaurants. That's great. And you said he worked about 25 hours a week. He did for a while. He might have started at that and then went down when he went back. Because one semester he worked and went to school and . That's a lot. Yeah. So I would say he started June or July. He worked through this last summer, so he would've ended in August. August. Mm-hmm . So he held that job for quite a while. Yeah. And his reason for leaving was because he- School. ... went to school. And do you have any other additional comments about this job? No. It's been really good for him to learn, to work with other people, and friends and to work with the people who were very supportive of him and understanding his diagnosis. It was a good experience for him. He liked it. He liked it better than the job before that because he liked the environment and learned that people were  on him. He had one manager there that he was like every day I would walk in and I would be afraid that she was going to fire me. Oh, go ahead. Because she just Didn't like . And so going back to the job that he had beforehand, what was that? So that was also dishwashing at Bridgestone Arena. I think he washed dishes for at least about four or five restaurants. That sounds like a lot of work. Yeah. And it was just like, people were scheduled. So sometimes he would be the only one there and like at first they didn't have any training. They train us in where stuff was and we went to be . That sounds very inconsistent. Yeah. So it was really frustrating. So sometimes he would be done at 10 in the evening and sometimes he'd be done around morning. How do you plan for that? And did he receive supports when he was there? I don't think so. Okay. Let's see. And how did he find this job? From a Job fair. And how many hours per week would you estimate that he worked? That was another weird thing about it because it was only when there were event. I have a friend who works at Bridgestone, it wasn't regular and his schedule is completely- It's like nuts. ...Crazy. I told him, he didn't want to be out in the crowd and I'm like, \"I'd be out there for the games, the concerts, I'm the one to be the vendor.\" He want to be more behind the scenes. Yeah. He want to be behind the scenes but he liked it. He liked being able to hear the concerts and stuff, but that was about the only thing he liked about his job, free concerts. That does sound like a nice perk. Yeah. So he probably worked, I don't know. I would say 10 hours a week. And do you remember when he started that job? I think he started in May three years ago. And when he left? Technically, he got fired because he didn't show up. Okay. But he didn't understand that... He was going to leave anyway because he just didn't like the job. He liked the job he had . Oh, so there was overlap. Yeah. So when did he? So he really kind of stopped working in June or July. So just a couple of months. So if he had a night off from the restaurant and he could work at the arena, he would do that. But he didn't understand that because it started out that they would call him each event and ask him if he would work that night. And so I think there was a period of time where they, for some reason they couldn't reach him. And so she had told him to look at the event calendar and let them know when he would work when he was . And I think he thought it was just for that month rather than ongoing that he was supposed to be looking at it all the time and let me know if he was going to come in or not. Okay. And were there any other employment or vocational or volunteering activities since high school besides those? I don't think so. Okay. Well, I think that we are good on that one. It sounds like he was busy That he's done a lot. He has. And so we were hoping that he would get some hours at the restaurant while he was home. But when I said the other day, I was like, probably a couple of weeks ago, I was like, \"we need to probably call and see if they'll get you on the schedule .\n",
            "finishAnd so he was not receiving services through the school system. Correct? That was through a vocational rehabilitation center and not through the school system? Yes. That is correct. He graduated the high school system. So I'm assuming since he was out of high school when we last spoke, his high school plans did not change since we spoke. So what month and year did he exit high school? Let me tell you, cause I actually have his graduation certificate right here.  Sorry. I have to dig through papers in order to get that. Oh, no problem. It's not something that we often refer to. It was more of a formality to graduate, rather than a big ceremonial hoopla. It looks like the official transcript... Graduation date May, 2018. Okay. May, 2018. And what type of diploma did he receive? He received a modified diploma. It took him an extra year to accomplish all of the requirements. That was the only modification was. It needed more time. Mm-hmm  Now we'll talk about some post high school activities, and we've discussed some of these. So you said he goes to his psychosocial group and goes to therapies like OT. But other than that, how has he been spending his time? Playing Minecraft on the computer. That's it. He doesn't like to go places. If given the choice \"Hey Andrew, let's go get some Taco Bell together as a family.\" \"No, I really don't want to.\" \"Do you want us to bring something back for you?\" \"Sure. A Beefy 5-Layer Burrito.\" Every single time. Mm . Now we'll talk more specifically just about his school program or the training program. So that was TRC, Tennessee Rehabilitation center in Smyrna. Yes. Yes. You've mentioned a bit about this program, but I was wondering if you could tell me a little bit more about what that all entails. You know what? I would much rather you call them up and find out what they currently offer. Oh, sorry, what he was receiving before they closed down. He was receiving classes in- they have different class programs that they can sign up for. He was on the track, and successfully completed the Customer Care program, which was a couple of semesters. And then because he graduated- he successfully completed that program. He received the recommendation, because the Customer Care program was also a prerequisite for the TRC Pharmacy Technician program. It's the basic Pharmacy Tech program for stocking shelves in the pharmacy, that kind of thing. He had just finished the customer care program, started the first quarter of the pharmacy technician program. He had started that program in January, February, and then mid-March, they closed the campus. He was just wrapping up the first quarter of the pharmacy technician program and when it closed. So just to confirm the entire curriculum is vocational training, correct? Yes. That is correct. It is not a college campus where English 101, et cetera, is taken. And did he do any of that training in the community, or was it all concentrated on campus? It is mostly concentrated on campus. Although I want to say that once a month they would do a small group field trip to a service organization, like Soles 4 Souls, where they go and look at different jobs and different programs in the community. And they learn a little bit about different trades that are out there. Was he getting paid at any of that training? No. Was he taking classes with other students without disabilities? No. These were all students that have disabilities. You said that he did the customer care program and then started the pharmacy tech program? Yes. Pharmacy Tech... And before it shut down, what was the average number of classes that he was taking per semester? He was taking... Oh, wait per semester? Mm-hmm . I would have to go and look, I know that his day was full from when they had... Oh gosh. What do they call it in the morning when you check in with your, your primary teacher? Homeroom. They have homeroom at 8:15 in the morning where they check in and do the attendance. And then they went on from one hour blocks of classes within an- So if you factor he was in classes until 4:00, 5:00 in the afternoon. But as part of his day, he would also be incorporated one hour and a half for lunch. They incorporated OT, PT, SLP multiple times per week. So he was receiving services and being in class Monday through Friday from 8:15 in the morning until four or five in the afternoon. Mm-hmm . So I'll say 8:15 AM to 4:15 PM... had classes and therapies. So do you have- and if not that's completely fine- but do you have an estimate for how many classes you think he was taking per semester at a time? No, because the classes changed every quarter. I'd have to- you're asking me to do an analysis that includes pulling out transcripts. Oh, no problem. Oh, that's... Yeah. No worries. And analyzing... No, you've definitely given me  information on this. Oh no, that's completely fine. And so he was... Okay. Ye`ah, no, I'm not going to make you dig through those. That sounds... You've already done a lot of work, and sounds like you deal with enough paperwork as it is. Yeah. I was going to say I'm tired. I got a draw line somewhere. No, that's completely understand- and by the way, we're almost done. Thank you so much for your patience and for being so willing to... Oh, thank goodness. Sure. Also the next follow isn't for another six months. So we'll give you a break. Oh, thank goodness. Okay. And so he was full-time and he started last January you said, and stopped in... No. He started the program in middle of two years ago. Okay. Would you estimate the Summer? July? Yeah. I think he started in August. Okay. And... August, September. And stopped in March of... Next year. And I will make a note of why that stopped. It was because COVID shut down the program. It sounds like you mentioned earlier that he was receiving a lot of support. He had nursing care there. And he had therapies... Did he have any tutoring there or educational accommodations? Oh yeah. Yeah. He had accommodations that were built into not only his classes, but also to help him with activities of daily living. Mm-hmm . Oh, that's great. Yeah. It was an all encompassing program at TRC. I'll definitely write that down. It sounds like you think it was a really good fit for him. It was perfect fit. If we could just replicate it now for the rest of his life, that would be wonderful. Mm-hmm . What made it a good fit it for him? You don't have to- You've already mentioned a lot, so if you wanted to just say like a little bit about it, that's completely fine. No, I think we've pretty much covered TRC and what the benefits were. I think so too. Yeah. Okay. And I think we are just about done. I was going to ask if there was- because it sounds like, besides the training program, he hasn't been involved in any other vocational activities after high school, since we last spoke. Is there anything else that you would like to tell us? I know you've already said a lot, so definitely no pressure in that department. Yeah. Well, and again, I don't know how much to divulge as far as being in the program, so I'm not going to go there. The resources that I've been able to dig up have been helpful. They've been helpful, but they've been confusing at times. So I think, you know, being- Is this the first year that you guys are the... I think it's called the Assist program or I don't even know what its formal name is. Yeah. This is our first year testing Assist. Okay. So I think being the inaugural year, you'll probably work out the bugs as you go along. It'll be interesting to receive support as the program further develops because obviously the information that we're given this year will need to have been updated as it gets clarified, corrected, amended for next year. Hopefully- I think the ask that I have is that rather than dropping all the people that are enrolled in the program right now, I would hope that, in some way, you would be able to provide the updated materials going forward, perhaps in a electronic version. That way it takes no mailing. It takes no paper product. It can be dropped into an inbox or retrievable through a Dropbox by us. So that way we have access to that updated, corrected, amended information in the future. Uh-huh . That's very important feedback that I am definitely making sure I am getting all down. Thank you so much for providing that feedback. Yeah. And it looks like... I'm looking at the fiscal part of it. There's no need for you to expend money on materials that could be easily retrieved online electronically. And so that's something. Even if it means that the person has to create a username and a password for the integrity of keeping that information limited to use by people who are in the program. I mean, it could be done through My Health at Vanderbilt. And that is something I will definitely bring up to the team. That is extremely helpful feedback. Thank you so much. And thank you so much... You are welcome. ...for taking the time to talk with us today. We are...\n",
            "finishSo to start with, I'm going to ask you about Andrew's... sorry, I'll just move this vocational and volunteering activities and what he did when he was in high school and what he did, when he finished high school. Yep. So let me get to this, I'll be typing some of your answers in the computer screen. Yeah. Has he ever worked during high school, Andrew? Did he ever... Worked? Yes? No. No? Okay. No, Andrew was home schooled. Okay. So that's good to know. He in public school up until... So I'm going to get a pen real quick. Yes. So Andrew was in public school up until seventh grade. Okay. Okay. We removed him from middle school, brought him home and it turned out when we had him assessed... Yes? It turned out that they stopped teaching him at the beginning of fifth grade. Okay. His IEP was not being followed. Wow. He was instead being asked to empty trash cans, do vocational kind of work. Yes. But not keeping him in the classroom. So in homeschool, what we did is during that seventh grade year.. Yes. Because we withdrew him at the end of the first quarter. Yep. Okay. We took him home, and for the rest of the semester and a little bit past January. Yes. We did fifth grade homeschool and then from late January, so this was like September to late January and then sixth grade, we taught him from February until June and then we took a break, okay? Then the next year we taught seventh grade. So he was only a year behind. That's amazing. Okay? Good for you. But we had to remediate... Yeah. Two grades, and we did a curriculum from Bob Jones University. Yeah. So we used the full curriculum. And so since fifth grade, his chronological age, seventh, but his fifth grade through 12th grade, we did Bob Jones University Press homeschool curriculum. And he did, he completed the whole course and he graduated with a high school diploma. Yeah. . So hopefully, I mean, we had to work really hard. He loves like, I mean, he's really good with spatial... Yeah. Memory and... Oh, that's good. Yeah. Okay. So that's good to know that he graduated. Yeah. Did he, I mean, even if he was comfortable, did he ever volunteer during that time? Like in some... Yes. The only extracurricular things that we did was we went, we're members of our church and we're active members. So he would go on Sundays and on Wednesdays to church. Yes. And there were opportunities for service there, there were also opportunities for socializing. The only other thing that we did was Boy Scouting. Oh, awesome. So he did a lot of service opportunities through the... we started him in Cub Scouts and then went into Boy Scouts and Boy Scouts is very much about service opportunities. So there was lots of service to the community. Yes. That was done. And that was during high school and after, or... Just during high school. Okay. Yeah. Great. Well, elementary through high school. Yes. Elementary through high school, once he was done with high school, and now that he's at the vocational, I don't know if he told you, but he's at the vocational center in Smyrna. Okay. So that's good to know. He's... I'm going to ask you all this so... Yeah, yeah. So no, he didn't tell me. Yeah. He's at the vocational center in Smyrna. So, and part of the requirement is they have to do, there is some volunteer work that they do as part of their stay there. Oh, so he's okay. Yeah. I think it's once a week or I don't know what the pattern is, but there is some sort of requirement. Okay. Yeah. Great. So for a typical week now, for his typical week, what does it look like? How often does he go to the vocational center? He is actually, so he will be moving into the dorm. Oh? Yeah, he's going to be moving into the dorm, January 5th. Wow.  week will change. Yeah. His typical week will change. And so he will have classes Monday through Friday, and then he will be at the dorm on the weekends and we can go visit him either in the evenings or over the weekends. That's great. Or he can come home for a weekend if he feels like it. Yes. Yeah. Does he have any other activities like hobbies or any sport that he like practices? He's not into sports. He he likes to play his computer game, Minecraft. Mm-hmm , yeah. He told you about that. Yeah. He likes to play a card game called . Oh, yeah. Sometimes Pokemon. Yeah. And he'll find friends that know how to play the games and play with them. Great. Yeah. Those are his limited things that he likes to do. And he's not working or are there... No. You'll... But are there any type of internships that, or... Not yet. Not yet, but this is what he's going to school for. Yes. He wants to go and become a pharmacy technician. Oh, that's awesome. Okay. Well, I mean, there's always jobs for them... Right. They have a lot of responsibility because... Yeah. ...They have access to medicine, so that's really cool. Right. Well, even if he works in the pharmacy where he's stacking shelves in the customer area and is available to answer questions about where can I find this? Where can I find that, somebody with autism knows exactly where the boxes are laid out. Yeah, and he... So he will be good at that. Yeah. And he has I mean, we were playing with some blocks and he made sure they were like perfect  So I think he's very organizing and at least that's my impression of him. Oh, okay. Oh no, that's good. Because he was like, even if the block was like this, he was like, \"No,\" I mean he's very detail-oriented. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So that's seems like a great fit. Yeah. And how many total hours is he going to have doing that? So total hours of... School? School, yes. So he has to have...so between school and they also provide physical therapy, they provide speech therapy, they provide occupational therapy. Okay. In total they have to be in class. I think they said 35 hours a week. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And has he ever been enrolled in an academic program? This is more of a... Training school. Training? Right. But has he ever been involved in any college or like... No. No? He did not. He wouldn't have been able to qualify. Yes. He couldn't go by himself. He couldn't get there by himself. Yeah. Okay. So since finishing high school he's been doing, this is the only vocational program? Right. It's not like...some people start with one and change or like... Yes. So this is the only one he's been able... Yes, this is the only thing that we've done. Yeah. So, and this is called the vocation center in Smyrna? Is that the name? It's called the Tennessee Rehabilitation Center. Okay...vocational center. Okay. And it's located in Smyrna, Tennessee. It's part of the State Department of Health Human Services. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. And it took about a year from start making the application for vocational services. Yes. To get to the school part took about a year. Wow. Because you have to get through the pre-qualification. Do you qualify? Do you... waiting for the classes to start, for a start date? So it took time to get involved in that. So the classes that he's getting, are those preset for him or does he have some type of big or say on what he's taking? Yeah. So there is some matriculation when it comes to the courses that are necessary for the pharmacy technician program. Yes. But then there's electives. Okay. And he has a say because of the number of electives that are available, and the number of hours that he has to be in school, he gets to pick, okay, we've already taken these classes, this is what's left. Which ones do you want to take this quarter? Yes. So we help him to make sure that the matriculation classes are listed, but then also for the classes that are the electives, he gets to say, \"Okay, this one I'm interested in.\" And if he has a question, we're an available resource to him say, oh, you know what? It might be handy since you hope to work in a pharmacy and it might not be a bad idea to take CPR and First Aid. Yeah. So here's the reason why. Yes. And so by explaining to him, he's like, oh, you know what? That's not a bad idea. So... That's right. He might be interested in that class. And how many classes is he taking right now, or like how many classes is he going to be taking when classes start? He's going to, oh, I don't know... Like not I guess... Hours. Do they have like credit hours or... No, it's not credit hours. Okay. Which is unusual. I could not get a straight answer when it came to that. They have to be in class 35 hours. Okay. But I don't know how many classes that is. I think it's about half. So maybe... Like 15? 15, 16 classes. Yeah, that sounds about right. And then two hours of class, so... Yeah. Yeah. And so he's a full time student? He is. Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes that's really, whenever we ask that question, everybody's like, \"No,\" because even like... Right. ...eight hours. Unfortunately the course catalog did not list credit hours. No, exactly. Which we asked them to. No, and even sometimes you don't know. I mean, some classes are six credit hours and some are one. Right. And so then it's... Yeah. But that's gives us the  full time. Right. And when did he start this training? So he started... Approximately... Yeah. I'm thinking about when did he start? So he's on Christmas break right now. And he, the program got, are you talking about the school? Yes. The school. He started the school, they had closed for a period of time, early October. Okay. So it was early October and he was there for the evaluation process before that, but the classes started for him, like October 5th or something like that. Okay. Yeah. Perfect. And is he receiving support from the program, like any type of accommodations... Yes. ...That were made specifically for him? Yes. And what kinds of accommodations is he getting? Like I was telling your counterpart... Yes. One of the things that he actually self-advocated for, he went to his counselor and asked if he could have an accommodation so that he could take a periodic break to de-stress. Yes. If he became overwhelmed, he just needed to be able to have a mechanism where he could show a card that's on his lanyard that says, \"I need a break.\" He came up with that idea? Well, the school has it for other students. Yeah. And he wondered if he could also be a part of that. So that way, when he did get flustered, he could say, \"I need a break,\" that way he doesn't go overboard. Yeah. So he would show that he asked for a break. We had a meeting with the campus psychologist, we asked him questions about, okay, well, how often would you need a break? How long would the break need to be? And we came up with a 10 to 15 minute break maximum for each instructional hour if needed. So he only needs a break maybe once, twice a day, maybe two, three times a day. Yes. And one of the goals that we developed was to get that down to one or less. Oh, that's . So, okay, that's reasonable, but him self-advocating to the school and saying, I think I need to have some sort of accommodation to be able to ask for a break and be able to not be punished. Yes. For asking for a break was very forward thinking of him. That's amazing. Yes. It was. And to know yourself that you need that or else you know... Right. Just we were very proud of him. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's very mature even. Yeah. So I know people like my age... Right. Yeah,  Who are working  need something, yeah, like this card. Yeah, I need a break. So any other type of supports or accommodations that... The only other accommodation is for handwriting. So if he has a written assignment, because his hands tremble neurologic, he has...central nervous system causes tremors. They allow him to do assignments using a keyboard. Okay, perfect. So if he needs to type something, he can use either a keyboard or his phone to be able to submit answers to sheets. Yeah. Okay. Great. And then has he ever participated after finishing high school, but before starting school in any type of employment or volunteering activities? No. No? No. Right, so we are done with this part. Okay. And now...\n",
            "finish... and so your dad and I talked about your college program at Austin Peay. And so I was wondering, do you feel that this program has been a good fit for you? Program as in being in the college? Yeah, just the college in general, not the specific autism program. The autism program sucks. The disability department doesn't do their job. The housing department doesn't care about disabled people. It's kind of terrible, but I have a feeling this type of ableism is everywhere, so there's no point in transferring. So I'm just going to put up with it until I graduate. I just want to make sure that I got everything you said. Sorry, by the way, she loves to be in on the interviews. Very cute. Thank you. You mentioned criticisms with the autism program, the disability department and what other aspects? The housing department, it's ridiculous. I'm supposed to have an accommodation where I don't have a roommate and they assigned me one anyways. And it took five months of emailing people with no reply until I asked someone who works at the college, an assistant professor who happens to be my dad's coworker's mom. And she called someone and then the next day the problem was fixed. Well, it's good for her that she was able to fix it, but it's kind of ridiculous that I couldn't fix it for months on my own. Mm-hmm . You said it took about five months? Yeah. From the time they assigned me the roommate to sending emails out. One email from the housing department that was like, \"Oh, we don't have single person rooms.\" And it was like, \"Well, you're ignorant. I have accommodation to buy out a room for the price of one. You don't need a single room. This is stupid.\" Yeah. But, whatever. Okay. I should be used to having my disability overlooked by this point. Yeah. And do you have any additional comments about this program? In summary, it's terrible. Mm-hmm . Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  they don't answer emails, they don't care about disabled people. Don't even get me started on the spectrum learning. They're a joke. So you said they don't answer phone or emails? Well, they might answer a phone. I just don't like phone calls. I probably should have called, but fool of me to assume that they can do their job via email, I guess. Because if we aren't  with technology. And what did you say about the full spectrum program? They're terrible. It's basically like elementary school, but in college. But you have to pay $3,000 for it. And if you're broke like me, you have to go to a whole other department. Like  rehab and have them pay for it, and it's so tedious. Just for those people to ... The class is literally ... They'll play you YouTube videos was made by other people about how to talk to people. Like take your class to middle school. Middle schoolers need to know this. College students should already know this. And when I dropped out of the program, rightfully so, it was a waste of time. Later, I tried to ask them for help with my housing issue, and they were like, \"Well, you should have stayed in the program.\" And that is so stupid to me that I have to pay them $3,000 just to get an ask of their consideration. And like go to their dumb class just for them to help me with my issues. Like you don't care about disabled people, you care about money. I've had a horrible experience so far, but whatever. I probably wouldn't have a much better experience anywhere else. Well, I'm sorry to hear that. And so now I think we'll switch gears a bit, and we'll talk about the goals that we set last year. Okay.\n",
            "finishOkay. So you said that she has exited the high school system and is enrolled in college. It sounds like since we last spoke, her graduation plans did not change, correct? That's correct. We were on this path since three years ago. When she got accepted into Austin Peary. What month did she graduate? I think it was May. Yeah, May of two years ago. And- I mean look, she didn't even do the... my son did the drive through graduation with his mom. Maya's kind of like myself, , we're, we're not big on ceremony or pomp and circumstance. We didn't even attend the graduation and stuff. We drove through and picked up her diploma at some point. But we didn't do any sort of like official, I put the little signs out in front of my yard to embarrass my kids, \"My kid's just graduated.\" That's about as far as we got on pomp and circumstance. And- So that's why the firm date is not really well set in my mind. Yeah. And especially with all the days melting together. What type of diploma did she receive? I'm assuming it was a typical high school diploma? Yeah. Typical high school diploma. And so now I'll ask about some post high school activities. So going more into detail about the academic programs and employment that she's been involved in. So what does a typical week look like for her now? How has she been spending her time? So a typical week for her is obviously like going to classes. She does have some friends. Although she has very mercurial relationships. It's very easy for her to rub people the wrong way and create hard feelings and then friendships sour and fall off. And she's struggling with that but I am impressed that she's still able to go out and kind of make friends. I think she also sustains herself somewhat by having a close relationship with some of her professors. They're usually interested in her intellectual curiosity and they're able to have conversations about the subject matter they speak. They're professors because they love talking about that stuff. And she's fascinated. I think she spends a lot of time alone but that's not atypical for us. Sometimes we like to be solitary creatures. So I like to just spend a day or two not seeing anyone. They're not interacting with anyone but that actually kind of vitalizes us. I'm sorry my nomenclature is kind of getting a little wonky. I'm still kind of messed up from that nonsense that happened in the capital yesterday. I'm still trying to get my brain back into like a normal set. Oh, yeah. That was a lot. Yeah. And then like on the week weekend, she spends a lot of time by herself in her room. And if she gets lonely and a friend can't hang out, she'll come down and see me. But that happens less and less. And I think it's because she's getting more settled into building a life in a new place. So she has things that she can do there. And she has events that she can go to and people that she can hang out with. Her sensory issues obviously makes that difficult and tricky. But here's the thing, she's one of the few freshmen there with her own car. I don't need to tell you how many doors that opens. So I think it's been a great lubricator in her social life. And so how many total hours during the week does she spend going to classes? I mean, she has a full workload. She has a full course load. I'm not really sure of the breakdown of... Oh, here. I can pull that up real quick. If you want to give me a minute. Yeah, sure. There you go. Updates on Maya's school. They have a parent portal that I can log in. Okay, so for this next semester, which hasn't started yet she has 15 credit hours. Oh and probably as a requirement, she dropped the computer and changed it to a three-hour course called Confronting The Other. That sound's interesting. Oh, that sound's really interesting. Yeah, so she's got four hours of Calculus, three hours of Confronting The Other, four hours of Astronomy and four hours of Physics. That sounds like a really interesting course load. So now we can go into talking more specifically about her educational program. So you said it was Austin Peary and so can you tell me a little bit about the program? Like what type of degree she's pursuing? Yeah. So I forget the exact ranking but I think this university is one of those universities that's in the sweet spot that balances affordability with quality of classes. I know a number of people who've been through Austin Peary. I've worked with some programs in the past. I think they're a good college. I went to TSU myself and I strongly encouraged Maya to find a better college than TSU. I'm not trying to throw shade on my alma mater. But I didn't know anything about colleges when I was picking colleges. It's a fluke that I got my PhD at Vanderbilt. If Trump University had offered me a PhD program, I would've accepted it because I didn't know anything about anything when I was choosing those. She has the benefit of some of the hard learned lessons that I've learned. And I also have access to some of my colleagues and stuff at Vanderbilt who are really good at giving advice about how to pick a good university. So there was a lot of work and effort, which I think is the normal way that most normal college, middle-class families go through. We did that with her. Austin Peary was not her first choice. She wanted to get straight into Vanderbilt and she didn't. And she took that very personally. I pointed out to her that she could still come to Vanderbilt for her graduate degree. And now she's excited and that's the new plan right there, is to get her undergraduate education knocked out and then maybe come to Vanderbilt for grad school. She's really excited at that possibility. So that's what she's currently working towards. And at Austin Peary you said she was enrolled in 15 credit hours and do you know the type of degree that she's pursuing like her major? Yes. Originally it was a more wishy-washy general Math degree or something like that. I just looked and it looks like she's updated her major to Physics. Okay and- So basically, she wants to go into Astrophysics but they don't have a spec separate so it's a Physics degree that she's currently pursuing. And would that be a Bachelor of Science in Physics? Yes. I'm sorry. Yes. Bachelor of Science in Physics And okay. And let's see Physics. And so you said she's enrolled in about four classes at a time? Yeah. She only had about 12 or 13 hours her first semester. I told her not to jump into the deep end. Take a reasonable load and then at the end of the semester, if you feel like you handled it then you can kind of build slowly. Don't try to do everything all at once. And she took that advice to heart. And did she start that this year in this August? Yeah. I could look through my calendar and find the exact time but yeah, sometime around in August is when she started. And you said she was receiving supports through the Spectrum Program but she's no longer receiving those supports. What kind of supports did they provide? Yeah. So the way the program works is that you had to check in with that program twice a week. You had to show them your schedule. A lot of the supports they have there is for people ho drop the ball or have some executive functioning issues. They have a lot of safeguards kind of built in to kind of help prevent that from spiraling. That's probably one of the number one reasons why autistic folks fail in a college setting is that they start getting behind or overwhelmed and they don't tell anybody. And then it snowballs to a point where it's too late to try and fix anything. They have all these supports in place to try to keep that from happening. So there's a lot of one on one meetings. There's a lot of going through their schedules reminding people to stay on top of their homework and stay on top of their studies. And maybe get them in contact with tutors, whatever if needed. There's a lot of hand-holding that goes on that Maya frankly, was offended by. And I was like, \"Honey, they don't custom build a program for you. These are just general tools. They're not doing this because they don't think you can do it. They're just doing it in case you can't.\" Which, everything is very personal with her. I think it's actually a pretty decent program but I guess in Maya's case a lot of the things that trip people up isn't necessarily a problem for her when it comes to the autism. For her it's primarily sensory and they don't really have anything in place. And when she had a meltdown and she went to them for help, I don't think they really properly understood how to try and assist her. From her perspective, they seemed somewhat dismissive and she got very offended by that and it kind of soured the relationship. And-` I don't want to throw at the program, but- Oh, no, that's completely understandable. ...I guess in her case, it may not have been the best fit. And overall though besides that, do you think that Austin Peary in general has been a good fit for her? Yeah. Austin Peary I think is a good university. And it kind of helps that I know some people there. And she's made some contacts there. Who you know makes such a big impact. But overall, yeah, I think it's a good little university. And what makes it a good fit for her? Honestly, in part, I think the fact that it's not very big. Like her dad, she has problems dealing with large crowds and stuff. So maybe smaller classes, smaller campus is something, especially for your first, go out into a strange environment, that's a good first step. The goal is to get her to where she can succeed in any setting, no matter how population dense. But in the beginning, starting out, I think that was a really good step for her. They have decent curriculum. I feel like the quality of the education there is up to par. And that's actually for somebody like myself or somebody like my daughter that's super important. If we feel like we're learning and we feel like we're getting a handle on material and our brains are expanding, that's like really important to us. And that puts us in a much better frame of mind and reference. And then we can deal with everything else in life a lot easier if we feel like we're getting that. If it's one of those courses, where it's just kind of the rubber stamp and you don't understand the material and you're passing anyway, we do not do well in a situation like that. And do you have any other additional comments about this program? Yeah, I wish they were more like them. I mean, they're expanding and they're growing. We were able to look at three universities within the reasonable distance of Nashville that had similar programs that I've heard a lot of good things about. So we're delighted that we had a choice and then just pick the one that she liked the most. But I really wish that that was the standard. There's a lot more universities. And I think maybe in 5 to 10 years time it will be but it's definitely something. The autistic population in the college population, we're there. And we need help whether people recognize this or not. And so it improves everything for everyone. It maximizes our chances of success, which is good for the university because they get higher rates of graduation. This is something that benefits all of us. Okay. And it sounds like that's been the only educational programmer that she's attended since we last spoke. And so now we'll move on to speaking more about employment. So she was working at Panera until she left for college, correct? Yeah, pretty much. And if I remember correctly, her job duties, that was like customer service and like working register or did she do something else there? Oh yeah. She can't handle meeting a lot of strangers and stuff that was off the table. Oh, okay. And so she did a lot of work behind the scenes. Her favorite job was a dishwasher because it's a very regimented and it's a very logical sort of thing. So she loved that. She was really good at that. She also did food prep. But I mean, they tried to force her to face customers and she had a bit of a meltdown over that. And eventually they realized, okay, this is obviously something she's not comfortable doing. So she worked in the back. And my primary goal for encouraging her to get that job was to get that life experience. That skill of being in a professional setting and dealing with coworkers, some people you like, some people you don't and learning the strategies on how to survive and thrive in an environment like that. And I think she came a really long way in just a year and a half that she worked at Panera. There was a lot of really positive changes. I think that's one of the reasons why she was prepared to go to college. That's great. And did she receive any supports while participating? At Panera? Not really. I mean, I did a lot of coaching and stuff. Some of her managers were understanding and some of them were, what's a nice way to say this, just bigots. Yeah. I remember she mentioned it. I can't come up with a nice way to say it. Some of them were very close-minded and somewhat confrontational. But the real turning point for her is when she won over some of the managers and then got those to advocate on her behalf against the other managers. That's really the best strategy for someone like us in a situation like that. And in a weird sort of way, I'm delighted that she had that experience because it impressed upon her the value of building allies and then having those advocates work on your behalf in situations where you can't really advocate for yourself. And how did she find this job? Well, it started with all of my kids. They saw their sister go out and get a couple of jobs. And they wanted some spending money. And then she surprised us all. She just woke up one day and said, \"I need to go get a job.\" And then she just walked a couple miles over to that area and walked around and asked and came to us and said, \"Hey, I got hired.\" We were like, \"What? You were looking for a job?\" She realized she wanted money and she just went out and did it. I'm so proud of her for that. Oh, wow. Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah. When she sets her mind to something she's capable of astonishing. It definitely sounds like it. And how many hours a week was she participating on average? As many as she could. But I would say probably on average, maybe about 20, 30 hours a week. And 90% of her money went straight into savings. She did buy herself little food things here and there but the vast majority of it she was saving up. She has a goal to be an independent, successful adult, as fast as humanly possible. She wants to be in a tax bracket where she can live in the type of neighborhood she wants and the type of home that she wants and the type of environment she wants. She sees the life that I have and she wants that as fast as possible. And so she is a very driven, focused-minded individual. And so everything that she's doing is marching down that path to success. So she takes that stuff very seriously. Yeah. It definitely sounds like it. And sounds like she's on a great path for that now and before, when we first spoke. Do you remember the month and year that she started working at Panera? I mean, it was about a year and a half ago. I'm just speculating these aren't really hard numbers, but I would say probably sometime in the summer of 2018. Do you think maybe- Early summer. ... like June of 2018 could be a good estimate? It might even be earlier than that. I think it was probably right after school. That's another thing sometime with her sensory issues and one of the ways that she stands is to work. And sitting at home and sitting in her room for hours with nothing to do is really unhealthy for her. And so I think one of the reasons why she wanted to work, she just wants to do something. And that's one of the things she loves about school is that she's really busy and she's in the heat of things and she's got stuff happening. And she's got all this regimented stuff that she has to do. And then suddenly the school's over and you're sent home and she's got nothing to do. And I think that might have actually been an impetus that kind of spurred her on to go out and get a job. So she had something to do and she'd be making money in the process, that for her was a double win. And- So probably May. And she left, you said around July? End of July, beginning of August. I think here. Now that is more recent on my calendar. I can go look that up real quick. Let's see. It was August the 17th when she moved out. Okay. And do you think that overall working at Panera was a good fit for her skills and interests? Well, I think it was not for her skills. Well, depends on how you define skills. But I think anybody on the autism spectrum should work a job not because that's what they want to do for their career but just the sheer act of being in a professional or semi-professional setting and learning how to get along with other people and learning how to follow orders and learn how to do new things. They are very important, fundamental skill sets that goes about on the spectrum, have to spend a lot of extra time and effort to learn something that maybe a lot of other people can just sort of like pick up naturally. We have to be more mindful of that sort of thing. So I think it was absolutely vital. There was a lot of really valuable things that she learned there. None of which had anything to do with like... she's not going to be washing dishes. Nothing she learned directly in Panera is going to be an impact in her job or her career do you understand what I'm trying to say? Oh yeah. So it sounds like more of the interpersonal skills. Yeah. But you said earlier that learning to work in that sort of environment and work with other people, that's what really helped her prepare for college? Yeah. I think it was a factor, absolutely. I think it was absolutely a factor. And I think whatever job she gets in or whether she goes to from there, some of the skills, going into a new job environment and learning how to do the work and then doing the job and getting along. I mean, you can't trivialize those skills. Those can make the difference between a successful transfer or just like freaking out and just quitting before you get started. So yes, she did learn skills that were very valuable for her college and going into the future. And none of those skills had anything to do with washing dishes or cutting cold meats or preparing salads or anything like that. Of course. And has she participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since we last spoke? I'm sorry? Has she participated in any other jobs or volunteering activities since we last spoke in January? No. The only other job that she had, she did a  summer thing in the summer. And so now I think that those are all of our questions. Is there anything else that you would like to tell me or any updates that you would like to share? No, I think I probably gave you all the details and then a bunch of extras on top of that. Yeah. And it's been great to hear about it all and to catch up.\n",
            "finishOkay. And so for this section, I'm going to ask about academic programs and employment and volunteering activities that she's been involved in since the last time we spoke last January, but first I'd like to get an idea of how she generally spends her time. So what does a typical week look like for her, and how has she been spending her time? So I'll be talking specifically about the summer, what's been happening the last four months. So she does her classes online. They're not particularly cognitively demanding or anything like that, so I don't think she really spends a lot of time watching the lectures and doing the assignments and stuff. Most of the time, that goes pretty easily. Although if she's having a bad sensory week and it's degrading her cognitive functions, then even simple things become hard. And then she gets kind of stressed out about deadlines and stuff. I've been working with her about, you're going to have that for the rest of your life. I've had that my whole life. And one of the most successful strategies that work for me is as soon as I can get it done, get it knocked out as early as humanly possible. Because if I've got seven days, I don't know if the six are going to be cognitive hell, and then I'm suddenly stuck with a deadline and I don't have time to knock it out. So if you're cognitively capable of it now, you do it now so you don't have to worry about it later. And then the amount of stress that that cut out of my life, like oh my God, this is due in a couple of days and my brain's not working right now, removing that from my existence was a huge boost to my morale and the quality of living. And I think she's starting to see the wisdom of that. So we're still working on that. But there are a lot of days when she's either just hanging out in my basement, doing her art, or she does a lot of things online. She does a lot of things with Instagram. She messages a lot of people. She has a few friends that sometimes she goes and she hangs out with, and those are pretty wholesome days. And she's pretty happy about that. But the problem is that if she wants to hang out right now and none of her two or three friends are available right now, she's really angry and upset with them. They have lives. They have things that are busy. They're not just hanging out in the wings, just waiting for you to say go. You can't be mad at somebody because they're busy or they've got other things going on. That's kind of an asymmetrical friendship, and not a lot of people are going to have the energy or the willpower to participate in a friendship like that. You've got to be okay with them not being available. But that's really hard. It's always been really hard for her to see things from other people's perspective. And so how many total hours per week do you think she spends participating in her college class activities? Oh, I would probably say about five to 10 hours a week. Five to 10. Okay. And so she's currently enrolled in school. And so if I remember correctly, she's enrolled in Austin Peay? Correct. And can you tell me a little bit about this program? Yeah, one of the reasons she selected that college is that it wasn't too far from home, so she knew that she could come home whenever she wanted. I had a hard time convincing her that an hour's drive is nothing. It took a little bit of talking. I actually had to take her out and drive her a couple of times before she went, \"Okay, so this isn't so bad. I can do this.\" We got into the program in part because it had an autism support program in it, which costs about $3,000 a semester, but that's where the . If I had to do it all over again, I think maybe I would've had her do a year or two at community college, and get part of the college experience on lockdown before she does the full move out, be by herself, and change everything about her life all at once. It was a really tough road for her. I imagine she'll probably continue to have a lot of problems going into the fall, but hey, she successfully completed two semesters, and she got a B in her physics and a B in her calculus, which the way she tells it- That's excellent. She thinks she should hang her head in shame and throw herself off a bridge. She's upset because she worked really, really hard and got a B. And I've been slowly trying to chip away at that perception. I went and talked to most physicists I know at Vanderbilt and asked them, \"Hey, if you took this on your second semester and got a B in both these classes,\" most of them are like, \"Yeah, I wish I did that well.\" And then I'm bringing those stories back to her because I'm trying to help her to understand that she did good and life isn't always about give it a little effort and get an A. Sometimes things are really hard and complex, and working really hard and getting a B is something she should be proud of, not ashamed of. Exactly. But it was really hard to break her out of one mindset and into another mindset. I guess in a way I'm happy that she's struggling with it at as early an age as she is, because all of life is like that. And the sooner she can figure out how to shift gears, the happier she's going to be. Yeah. And physics and calculus, those are challenging classes, Especially if you've never taken a physics or calculus  is, yeah, it's astounding. She worked her butt off, and I'm super proud of her and I'm sad that she's not more proud of herself. And it sounds like she was involved in the autism program, but now she's no longer, so this is not an autism or disability specific program? Okay. And what is her area of study or her major? So her first semester was English, and now she's at physics. Physics. And what is the average number of classes that she takes per semester? She takes the bare minimum she needs to be full-time, so 12 hours, which I think is a smart move for cognitively demanding complex classes. This 12 hours she put in the fall, I don't think she could've handle a second . The way she tells it, she couldn't handle it at 12, but I think she did really well. And so 12 hours, is that about four classes? It was actually three classes of four hours each. Oh, okay, three classes? Yeah, it was physics, astrophysics, and calculus. And then each of those had like an hour of lab. Okay. So three classes, three labs. So four hours each for three is 12. Okay. And do you remember the month and year that she started at Austin Peay? I want to say August. And is she currently ... Oh, sorry about that.  Sometime around that time. Most likely August. Is she currently receiving supports from the program? No. She does have a, I mean, she filed for accommodations and stuff. She does have those, but no services. And so for the accommodations, what types of accommodations does she receive? So she receives extra time when she needs it, a note taker if she needs it. She had an accommodation where she was going to have a room by herself, her own room. She can't hardly handle her. She can't deal with another person in her space. That just causes too much stress and anxiety, and God help whatever poor girl ends up having to share a room with her. And then you get something where , and you can't do that by yelling at people and calling them stupid. That doesn't win hearts and minds. And do you feel that this program, that Austin Peay has been a good fit for her? I would say not really, but I also recognize that the pandemic, a lot of people did not pivot well, a lot of universities did not pivot well. And some of the problems that she's had could almost be attributed to the bureaucratic nightmare of switching from in-person to virtual. I hope my answer makes sense. Yeah, no, that definitely makes sense. Switching from in-person to virtual... Although, honestly, I don't know, because it was her first year. They could be systemic, but I recognize, maybe not. Ask me again in a year. I'll have a good answer for you. I think we will, actually. And do you have any additional comments about this program? I thought the, I mean, the autism program itself, I think it's a great idea. I think the problem is it's too rigid and inflexible, and it speaks to one particular flavor of autism. And it doesn't seem to be very good at dealing with a spectrum. So a lot of the supports and stuff they have in there, the right autistic person absolutely needs those supports. Amaya did not. And they ended up becoming an unnecessary burden, some extra steps that she didn't need. And I think they were also very, I think there was a strong gender bias there, and I don't mean anything negative by that. Autism expresses differently between men and women. And I think that program was tailored for autistic men fairly well, and doesn't really take into account that women on the spectrum don't necessarily need these supports, but there are supports that they need. It's one of the reasons why I was so , like she just cut them off before I knew what was happening, because we could have sparked some conversation. We could have worked with the folks over there and gotten them to expand or improve upon that program. And all of that was taken off the table by a childish temper tantrum. And now there can be no discussion. And does she currently, or has she been enrolled in any other academic programs since we last spoke in January? No. And so now we'll talk about some vocational activities. So is she currently participating in any employment, vocational, or volunteering activities, or if not, has she participated in these since January? No. I mean, she's toyed around with the idea of getting a job, but she recognizes that it takes a lot of cognitive energy to be successful in college. She doesn't really have the bandwidth for that. That's completely understandable. And...\n",
            "finishSo I just wanted to clarify, so he is currently enrolled in college. Mm-hmm . Okay. And when did he graduate high school? Six years ago. And do you happen to remember the month? May. Okay. And what kind of diploma did he graduate with? It was a regular diploma for him. Okay. And so for the rest of the interview, I'll ask about academic programs, employment and volunteering activities since last January. So what does a typical week look like for Gordon now and how has he been spending his time? So now, since I've been out of school in December, he flip flopped his sleep schedule. So he's awake all night and sleeps all day, which can be the frustration because there are things that need to be done obviously during daylight hours. There are things he needs to do. And so, that's a frustration to me because I can't seem to get it across to him. The rest of the world is not up all night to be available to what you're needing. Or what you want. So right now, I mean, I don't know because I don't know what he does all night. I know he does some online. He's got some online friends that he does gaming with and talking with. Other than that, I mean, that's all I know. His head is stuck in his phone all the time while he's awake. And is he currently taking classes online? Does he what? Is he currently taking classes online? Well, if he gets registered today, if they let him register today, he will. Probably yes, pick them online. But in the fall, yes, he took them all virtual or online. Okay. And so, and he is currently enrolled in school? No. No. Okay. No, because he's on academic suspension at the school in West Virginia. So, he's wanting to take some classes here in Nashville, but the deadline was Friday and he thought it was yesterday. So he's supposed to be calling to see if they will let him do a late registration. I don't know if he has done that or not. So, yeah. Okay. And so now, we'll talk a bit more about Marshall University. And so from what I remember about that program, it's a program specifically for adults with autism? Correct. And can you tell me a little bit about the program? So they do, they work with him and with his instructors. They advocate for him. They have one on one time with him, or I can't... I always want to call it a supervisor, but I don't really know what it's called. So he has someone who's kind of over him and I believe they meet at least weekly. He also has a graduate assistant assigned to him, who also works with the team and with the instructors and with him. And so they would meet maybe a couple of times a week at least, and work on homework and whatnot. Help him get registered for classes that, like the first day or first week or whatever. And even, they'll walk him to his classes to make sure he knows where they all are. He thinks ahead of time to make sure he knows how to get, that he already knows how to get logged in and all that because they do a lot. I mean, even as far as they will call him every day to make sure he's awake for class. Oh, wow. I mean, yeah. And are his classes with people without autism too? Yes. Okay. And yes. And yeah, and this program also has weekly activities for all the students in the program. He always chooses not to attend those. When he does, he has a good time, but getting him to go is just, yeah. Actually, by the time he decided to start going was when COVID hit and then they were on lockdown. And so that was the end of that. And so he hasn't done any of the virtual ones with them. And so how many of his classes was he taking without students with disabilities? Was that some or all? How many, I'm sorry? How many of the classes he was taking, how many were with students who did not have disabilities? I would say all. I mean, it's a regular college campus. And what was his area of study? Oh, sorry about that. Oh, it's fine. But yeah, I mean, it's a regular college campus, so they're going to have. Now the thing about Marshall that is really cool is that all of the students are aware of this program, and a lot of those students volunteer to help with that. Oh, that's awesome. They're all very, yeah. I mean, it's really wonderful that... Yeah, the students and the staff all are aware of the program and the students and so are really good about helping out. And what type of degree is he pursuing there? So he is pursuing physics. And is that a bachelor of arts or bachelor of science? I believe it's a bachelor of science. Okay. And okay, let's see. And what was the average number of classes he was taking per semester? So they had dropped him down to nine credit hours because before that, he was taking 12 to 14 and it was just too much with his processing fee. He took that many. And so was he full-time? Yeah. Yes. And do you remember the month and year he started the program? He started in July of, let me think, '19. And you left around the end of this semester, so like December? Right. Right. And you said it was because of academic suspension. Correct. And I was wondering if you wanted to elaborate on that a little bit. So because of his processing speed and because of, and like I said, I didn't realize this was the issue until this semester, that he wasn't doing his homework. And when he was, he wasn't turning it in. And so that's where his grades suffered. I mean, he did everything he needed to, but we could not get him to turn his homework in. Could not. And we don't know what the roadblock is. So because of that, some of his classes, the homework was very heavily on his grades because he made this 2.0. And so, yeah. I mean, he's bright enough to do it. The one class that he got a D in the semester that should have easily passed. I mean, because he got 100 on his final exam. Oh, wow. And probably the lowest score. Yeah. And probably the lowest score he got in that class was an 80. But because he didn't turn in his homework, he didn't get. I mean, plus, they were very accommodating because they could see it. They could see. That's the thing, that they can see the potential. They can see how bright he is and the potential that he has, but we don't know how to get him to do that piece of it. And so in terms of support, so some that you mentioned was that they work with him and his instructors and they advocate for him. And he has one on one support with like homework and registering for classes, and they even call to make sure he's awake for class. Were there any other supports that I missed or accommodations? I mean, yeah. Probably have missed some myself. I mean, they were just, God, they were so wonderful. Because really, I think that's the first school I've dealt with where they haven't said, \"He's over 18. He can't talk to you.\" I mean, from anybody on campus. So, they offered counseling but he didn't take it there, but which is fine. We got him in one here. So I think that there were probably other things that they've offered that he's not chosen to be a part of, but I wish he would. I wish, because I think it was a really good... They offered so much, but I mean they were so good about staying in contact with me and him. I would get sometimes several emails a day or phone calls and really, really on top of what he needed. That's great. And so do you think this program was a good fit for him? I think it was he had to interview to get into the program and he was sick that day and I didn't know it. But as soon as he stepped on campus, he was like, \"This is it. This is where I'm going.\" He just knew, and his interview obviously went really well. I think it was a good thing for him. I hope that he can continue. The suspension is supposed to be for a year, but they may allow him to come back in the fall. So we'll see what happens.  I don't know if I answered your question. I can get sidetracked sometimes. Oh, yeah. No, that was perfect. Sorry. I was just catching up on notes. Yes. Okay. And so do you have any other additional comments about this program? Or it sounds like we covered a lot with it. Yeah. No, I don't think so. I mean, I just think they've been really great. So, I would recommend them to anybody who's considering their child. And we know that there are schools that are closer that have autism programs, but he wasn't interested in those schools either. So for whatever reason, so it worked out well. And you said that he might be attending classes online at a Nashville school soon? Yeah. If he got registered, if they let him do the late registration. Okay. And you mentioned that there were no changes in his employment, like he wasn't working last year around this time and he's currently not working. Correct. Okay. And so is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you want to share? I don't think so. No. I think if he doesn't get into classes this semester, I really want to work with him on things around the house, learning to cook, learning to drive, learning to keep his, clean up his personal space. I can't say much. I mean, I'm a horrible housekeeper. And especially as my health, from day to day, I don't know what I'm going to be able to do physically. So I'm going to need more help. And if he's not going to school or working, maybe this is the time to work on some of those skills that we haven't had time to work on. Mm-hmm .\n",
            "finishSo for this section, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities, that he has attended since January. So the last time that we spoke, but first I'd like to get an idea of how he normally spends his time. So what does a typical week look like for Andrew? And how has he been spending his time. Since January? Yes. Or, or currently what a typical week looks like for him? Okay. Currently a typical week is, as far as doing things, all right, doing things. Because we have, there's hygiene rituals and there's medication rituals, but I'm not going to bore you with that. The things that he does right now, he has one program that he's a part of. He attends Wednesday, Thursdays, and Fridays, half a day. It's a psychosocial program that he participates in. He gets picked up in the morning, driven to the program, participates, has lunch, has a little bit more participation for the extended program. And then is picked up by the transportation company and brought back to the home. So that happens on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays. The remainder of the week, his days are occupied by playing Minecraft. And is this psychosocial program, is this through his CLS program or is this something external? It's external. Okay. And I just, I would love to ask just a few more questions about that. So, is this psychosocial program, does it have a name? Yes, it is. You want to know who provides it? Yeah, it would be great. All right, it is Centerstone. Centerstone. And, do you pay for any of this Centerstone service? No. And, and how satisfied are you with it? I am, I would say that's a three. That's a three. Great. And this is a psychosocial program, that he attends three days a week? Correct. Okay. Okay, one moment, and then we'll continue to the next set of questions. Okay. And so is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a Vocational School, Community College, or College since the last time we spoke this January? In January, at that time, he was enrolled and attending, living at, Tennessee Rehabilitation Center. That lasted until mid-March. Of this year? When? Oh yeah. Oh, no, not of this year. Of last year? Of last year.  Okay. So had been enrolled in TRC, but shut down in March last year. Correct. And, and you had mentioned earlier that he has not participated in any employment activities. But what about, has he participated in any volunteering activities since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And so now we'll speak about the goals that we talked about.\n",
            "finish... are agencies to help with services during COVID. Have you changed providers or agencies, and if so, why? No, we haven't changed any. He did at that time, go through counseling and some of it was face to face, and some of it was virtual, or telehealth, I should say but that was really it. Nothing else has really changed. Mm-hmm . Have there been any changes in your services that you expect to be long term? Meaning that services will never go back to the way they were before? COVID Not that I can think of. Okay. Are there any changes to your services that you wish would be long term? No, not that I can think of. Okay. How do you make decisions about whether to resume services impacted by COVID? So what considerations do you have when making these decisions? What, I'm sorry? What considerations do you have when making these decisions about whether to resume services impacted by COVID? Basically, just safety concerns, I think is the only... I know people who are not vaccinated that don't mask, and if I didn't know them personally, I wouldn't know it. I'm sure that there are many other out there doing the same and especially with me being immunocompromised, we just have to be more careful about that. Of course. How involved is Gordon in making these decisions? Gordon is specially for himself, he's  and everything.  Oh sorry? No, go ahead. How was the service provider or agency involved in making these decisions? How is what agency? How was the service provider or agency involved in making these decisions? What do you mean the service provider or agency? I'm sorry.  If there's a service provider or agency that you had in February last year, if they're involved at all in making decisions about whether you resume services, or if that doesn't apply, then that's okay as well. Yeah, I think right now it doesn't apply because the only one that we really need to look back into is rehab as far as what was involved in and not . Mm-hmm . Okay. Now we'll move on to talking about some activities that he might be involved in. You mentioned that he was in college. Okay, now we'll talk about yes, some post-high school activities that he might be involved in. First I want to ask about what a typical week looks like for him. What does a typical week look like for Gordon, and how has he been spending his time? Right now, he is just pretty much home all the time. He's not working, he's not going to school, but really kind of just hanging out. If I find some chores that I know that he can do without a lot of prompting, I'll have him do some of those, pretty much he is just kind of hanging out. Okay. You mentioned that he is not in school, but he was at Marshall University. I just wanted to ask, is he currently enrolled still in Marshall University, or is he no longer enrolled there? He's not because he aced the tuition benefit. Okay, yeah. Yeah, to pay state school is more than we can handle.  Mm-hmm . Okay, so now we'll move on to talking about the goals that we set last year. During the first visit we set three annual goals, and the purpose of this goal-development was to support families and helping the young adult pursue their dreams for future, and really start working on these goals. Since about a year has past, we'd love to know how he's been doing with these. Before we continue to discuss his progress, we do feel it's important to say that we understand that a lot can happen in a year, and this past year was especially unpredictable. We also understand that COVID- Right.  ... might have posted some barriers. All of that said, the first goal was \"Youth takes steps for applying to an internship.\" For example, steps like researching potential options, setting up an interview and applying for an internship, with the focus of this goal being on the steps that he takes for finding a summer internship. How has he been doing with this goal? We actually did talk to somebody last year about an internship, but the program of course, due to COVID, it didn't happen. I believe it was the same thing this year that they were not looking to do that again this year due to COVID. That's th only part that got us. We inquired, and there was a place that would've been interested in him, but due to COVID they didn't because  this year or last year.  Mm-hmm , oh, I'm sorry to hear that. One moment, and then we'll continue to the next goal. Okay, the next goal was, \"That he completes one housekeeping activity per week, with the focus being on how frequently he completes a housekeeping activity.\" Over the last year how has he been doing with this goal? One housekeeping thing per week... Yeah, he has kept up with that. Oh, that's great to hear. How often would you estimate that he does a housekeeping activity per week? Or how many per week do you think he does? At least one. He's the one who takes the trash. Every week gets it together and takes it out. That's mainly what he does.  Great. You mentioned that it's at least one, and that sometimes he might be more than one. How often do you think he does more than one per week, or does a housekeeping activity more than once a week? I'm trying to think, not very often, but I'm thinking that recently he's done a little more. I can't think specifically. Mm-hmm . You said recently he's done more than just once a week? I'm thinking so, and it may just be more of the recycling what I'm thinking, but I'm not sure. I can't even remember what I'm thinking of. You said trash and recycling generally? Yes, trash and recycling. Okay, great. Then the last one is that he runs once a week with the focus of this one being, how frequently he goes on a run. How has he been doing with this goal? He has not been running in quite some time. Mm-hmm . You mentioned that he hasn't been running in while, but when he was doing his best over the last year, how often was he going on runs over the last year when he was doing really well with it? I don't recall him doing anything since he's been back home from school. I can't speak for when he was at Marshall.  Mm-hmm . Have there been any barriers to him working on-\n",
            "finishHe's technically a senior, but he will go back for one more year to complete his occupational diploma. Assuming that school goes back that, yeah. So if school doesn't go back, we may re-look at options. If that makes sense. Yeah, I know that things are really unpredictable right now. Yeah. Because remote learning is not something that he can do as far as what he does at school, because what he does at school is work based learning, meaning he goes to a job site. So if for any reason they don't go back to a typical school schedule where he can go to a job site with his class, then we may have to look at trying to get him into vocational rehab or something. If it's something that he can do, I don't know, the way things are opening and not, and closing and stuff. They're more concerned on the school systems and stuff about, they haven't decided how they're going to do it yet. Yeah. And has he ever worked during high school? Yes. This last year, the work based learning program, the way it went is Monday through Thursday, he went to a job site from like 9:30 to 12:00 and his particular job site was an assisted living facility that's close to the high school where he went and he set up one, he cleaned the tables and set up one, the dining room for lunch. So cleaned tables and let's see- Swept the floors and set the tables for lunch. And I mean, talking table cloths and full table settings, he had probably three or four different tables he had to do. That's great. Yeah. Other job sites that they have is like Kroger and that may be the one that he does this next school year, if he goes back. And so did he do anything at Kroger before this or? No, he has not done it. I'm just saying that's another one that they offer. Oh, okay. He did not do that one. And he worked there approximately six hours per week. Let's see, four days a week. Yeah, approximately. I tried doing that math in my head really fast, but that's not a strong suit. Yeah. Six or seven hours. I'm not exactly sure. As far as transportation wise, I mean, it was basically a five minute drive, so it's not a long drive or anything. And then basically the way school day went, he did that four days a week, Monday through Thursday, two days a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays, right after that, they go to the central office for the school district and they have a jobs lab where they get to work on specific types of jobs, whether it's data entry or they have all types of different kinds of jobs that they can do. And they're required to clock in there, pull their folder for what they're assigned and do the work. And then they're, they may have to continue doing that over a series of days before they complete it satisfactorily or where they can complete it in a timely fashion type thing. And it's to kind of gauge where their strengths and weaknesses lie. That sounds like a great training program. It is. I mean, he's enjoyed it, which is why we wanted him to leave because he does have the option to go back for a year. We kind of wanted him doing that for one more year before trying to put him into a voc. rehab program or getting a full-time job. And with the assisted living facility, do you remember what month and year he started that? It would've been August last year. Okay. And did that go until the schools shut down around March? Yes. And he did not go when school was on break because he only went when school was in session. So, but yes. And did he receive support while working, from teachers? Yes. They have a jobs coach that goes with them to the job site and then there is also a supervisor, that works at the place that, but they do have a teacher one or two teachers that are there to support them and give them help if they need it. So a job coach from the school and then a supervisor from the facility? That's correct. Okay. And do you think that this job was a good fit for his skills and interests? I don't. I think he liked going there because he liked seeing the residents because he enjoys visiting with people. I think setting tables and cleaning up is difficult for him. So I, they were telling me at his last IEP meeting that he really seemed to flourish in the jobs lab as far as data entry type things. He was very good at doing things like that. Read input things specifically into spreadsheets and stuff like that. So that might be more of a better fit for him as far as a job goes. I think he liked the job he got to visit with the people that lived there. Yeah. Very sociable. So he did great and he's sociable with other people not us. And did he ever volunteer in the community during high school? Volunteered for our church's Vacation Bible School since seventh grade. They're not having it this summer because of the COVID but every year since seventh grade, he volunteered in that in the music department for that. Oh, that's great. And then last summer we required him, he volunteered at the center where he gets his occupational therapy. They have a summer program for younger kids with special needs. So we asked him to do three hours every morning, five days a week, last summer. So it was kind of like going to a job, but not, I mean he wasn't being paid for it or anything and he did okay with that. He wasn't great because younger kids with disabilities tend to react, don't know how to control their emotions as well. He doesn't deal well with that, but he liked working in the office if they gave him like stuff to file or put away. So he liked being in the office. He did not like working with the kids though. Yeah. Okay. Well this one is done and I'm just going-\n",
            "finishOkay. And so for high school, you've talked about that a bit. I just wanted to confirm, you said that he graduated high school last year but he is now in work based learning. Is this a transition program? It is and it's... Well, I mean, because special needs kids are allowed to stay at the high school till age 22. So even though he technically was able to graduate with his class, with an occupational diploma, he is still eligible to continue with it. It's called an alternative adult work based learning program. I mean, and he attended that program even during his high school years. He started at his junior year of high school. It's the same program he was doing in high school but because he is only 19, he is still allowed to participate in it, even after he graduated. And did his high school or did his plans or track change since the last time we spoke? For instance, deciding to stay longer or anything like that since the last time we spoke? No, I believe that we had already decided to keep him on track at the high school when we spoke last. And when is he planning on exiting the school system entirely? The program, we want him to stay in at least one more year. They have a new program that is not at the high school but is at Cumberland University in Lebanon, which is in Wilson County, which is where we're located. It's still Wilson County school system, so he's still part of the Wilson County school system. But he would be going to the universe. They have a space at the university and he would work at the university. And also get to, he would get to participate in like an actual class at the university with typical peers and do other things with the typical peers there. So we want to keep him in the school system for at least one more year to participate in that program. That sounds like a great program. And so you said that you'd like for him to stay at least one more year, so he could do that. Do you know what his projected exit date is in terms of the month and the year, that you think he'll stop receiving services through the school system? If he only does this class for a year, he would exit in like May next year, but we haven't made a final decision because he hasn't done. He hasn't actually participated in that program yet. So if we feel like he might actually benefit from staying another year, because he's allowed to stay in the school system until he is 22, it's possible that we would continue it. He's on the fence for not continuing because he feels that he's starting this job in the summer and he wonders if he should just keep it, rather than go back to the school system. But we think that there's more opportunity for him to learn different job skills and also be around his peers more if he stays in the system for at least another year. And you mentioned that he is currently working through work based learning at school. How many jobs is he currently working? He just has the one. I mean, they take him to Kroger for three hours a day, four days a week. And you mentioned that he doesn't receive payment at this job and you said... No. He works at Kroger. Sorry. Oh, sorry about that. And how did he find this job? It's through the work based learning class. They have different places. They have three different places where kids can go and do jobs. One of them is the Kroger, our local Kroger here in Mount Julia. I think some of the kids go to the Goodwill store. Last year, he actually worked at an assisted living place, setting up their dining room for lunch. But because of COVID obviously, that had to stop and they're not allowing them to do that again right now. And what month and year did he begin working at Kroger? That would be September lasts year. Because that he just started at this school year. Last year, he worked at an assisted living place. And this is part of school programming. Can you tell me a little bit about the job and what he does there? From what I understand from him, he does some cleaning. He cleans the break room, he cleans the glass in the refrigerated section and he also bags groceries. And does he receive any supports while working? They have a job coach from the school that stays with him to make sure that he stays on task. And do you think that this has been a good fit for his skills and interests? Yes. And what makes it a good fit? He enjoys being around people. Oh, that's great. But I think manual labor is something that is going to be difficult for him in the future. So they also work with him. Through this class, they also go. They have the county school system at their central office has what's called a jobs lab that they go to once a week and they practice different kinds of jobs. So they've said that he does really well with data entry and stuff in the computer. So we're really kind of hoping he can eventually find something in that field, that would be less manual because I think in the future, his back and his legs are going to be an issue as far as doing manual labor. Oh, well, that's really exciting about data entry. That's great. And... Yes. And so has he worked and left any jobs, other jobs since June last year, since the last time we spoke? No. And has he volunteered in the community during high school since the last time we spoke? Not since the last time I spoke because of COVID. I mean, he had volunteered prior. He had volunteered at church prior to that, but COVID kind of put a stop to that. And are there any other updates or anything else that you would like to share with us today? Nope. Okay, great. I think that's pretty much everything. Yeah. Well-\n",
            "finishTo be involved in and, so earlier you mentioned that he is no longer in high school. And so did he exit the school system since April, the end of April of this year? The last time we spoke? Yes. And, and so what month did he graduate or leave the school system? Right. Well, he went through graduation the summer of last year, but he completed another year at the high school after that. And so he exited the high school. It would an effective June of this year. Okay. And so now I'm going to talk, ask about some academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's attended since the last time we spoke last April, but first I'd love to get an idea of how he normally spends his time. So what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? Typical week is he works. He works Monday through Thursday, 10:00 to 3:30 and Fridays from nine to noon. He works 25 hours a week. He basically sleeps until he has to go to work. When he comes home in the afternoon, he sometimes is tired and takes a nap and then pretty much stays in his room and occupies himself until dinner. He does occasionally go out and take a walk around our neighborhood. He enjoys going to the weekly high school football game still. If they're at home, He enjoys going. He still likes go watch theater performances at the high school or at the local theater group here close to us. And that's pretty much it. I mean, he's in his room a lot when he is home. He'll sometimes think, engage with us if there's sports on. And, Or a game show And his job, is he working independently or is he receiving direct supports? He works mainly independently, but he does receive, he's not receiving support as far as like through vocational rehab, but he does. I mean, like I said, he, he works in a, with a group of therapists, so he does have onsite support therapy if he needs it. I know with his occupational therapy, they actually work through some of his jobs duties to make sure that he's able to complete them without, with little help. And so just confirming, it sounds more like working independently with supports available rather than something like supported employment. Is that correct? That correct. Okay, great. And so is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in any academic program at a vocational school community college, college, or university since we last spoke in April? No. And, and so I'd love to know more about his job. And so you mentioned earlier that it is working for pay independently. What is the name of his workplace? Dynamic Therapy Center Dynamic Therapy Center. And I think earlier you mentioned that he, his duties include, like keeping the rooms clean and what is He basically. Yeah, he, he cleans up the therapy rooms in between therapy sessions. He makes sure to wipe down any public spaces, frequently during the day for COVID purposes, he washes dishes, does laundry, he takes out the trash, sweeps him up the board. I guess it's more of kind of a custodial type job. And, and you mentioned that he does receive supports while participating just in the sense that it's a therapy center and they are very familiar with him and his needs. That's correct. Okay. That's that's great. Yeah. And you said that he's been going to the therapy center since he was quite young? Yeah, since he was three and a half. Oh, wow. Yeah. Okay. So, I mean, there he's very comfortable there. He basically told him when he was older, that he was going to work there and they actually gave him a job. So, Aw, that's wonderful. And is he paid at this activity? He is. And, and he found this job because he had been a patient there. Correct. And you said it was 25 hours a week. And what month and year did he start this activity or this job? Sorry, July, this year. I'm sorry, June, middle of June. So sorry, June, this year. Okay. And do you think it's been a good fit for his skills and interests? I do for now? Yes. And what makes it a good fit? He makes it a good fit is that he is comfortable. He's in a environment that he is familiar with and comfortable with. It makes him more likely to be able to ask for help if he needs it. I think he'd be more scared to ask for help if he were in an environment that he was not familiar with. And are there any additional comments that you have about this job? No. Okay. And is he currently participating in any other employment, vocational, or volunteering activities or has he, since the last time we spoke, even if he's not now? No, he is not currently the same thing. The only thing that he participated in since April was he was still in school at the high school. So he was still participating in their work based learning program through until June. Okay. And what did that work based learning program look like That, that program and mean he was at the high school. I mean, so he would go to the high school it's normal and they would work on different life skills in the class, and then they would also take them to job sites. So he was working at Kroger, doing clean up as far as I think he would do things like clean their break rooms and wipe down surfaces, like in the frozen department area at Kroger. And sometimes he would bag groceries. And was he paid at that activity? No. Okay. And do you remember when he started working at Kroger? He had the Kroger job For the last and this year. Okay. So it would've been, it would've been August or September of last year through may of this year. Okay. And then one moment, and then we'll continue to the next set of questions. And do you feel that this was a good fit? The Kroger was a good fit for his skills and interests? Sure. Yeah. And It was good because I mean, he's a social person, so it allowed him to meet new people And he left because it ended? He left because the school year ended and then he didn't go back to school because it was all part of his school, his workday learning program at school. Okay. Well great. Thank you so much. And now we will continue to the next set of questions, which is about goals that we set.\n",
            "finishActivities that she might be involved in, so she is out of high school and exited the high school service system before the last time we spoke in April, I remember.

What does a typical week look like for her, how has she been spending her time?

Oh, sorry about that. It just they had some clients, it was a really like they didn't have a lot of customers. What was her reason for leaving this job? They didn't have enough customers. Okay, so lastly, we will talk about goals that we set last year.\n",
            "finishAsk you a few questions we're done with that part, to do everything he can and not do. Awesome. These questions have to do more with vocational and volunteering activities. So with him, if, since he's, haven't had a job yet, maybe I'll ask you what he's doing in the Transitions Program and some information about that. And after that this one is really brief. After that, I'll have you complete a survey, if that's fine? Sure. But what type of, so he graduated high school or he had a certificate of completion? Yes, exactly. And this transition program that he is doing is still through high school? Yes. He goes to DuPag High School. Okay. And did he volunteer in the community during high school? No, he didn't. And what is, so now what does a typical week look like for him? How is he spending his time? School then home and computer. Video game time, basically. And how many hours is he at school per week? Let's see. So every day from eight to three. So that's seven hours a day. About 35 hours at school. Monday through Friday. Okay. And what type of classes, I guess, or courses is he taking? I don't- Even if they are like daily living skills, I don't know if they're named that or if there is a division of courses, but maybe it's not structured in that way. It's all in one classroom, but yeah, they do focus on daily living skills. They still have math and reading. Life skills. And then he gets computer skills because we've written that into the IEP. And then he's also doing some job shadowing or is that- He goes with two other students and two aides and two days a week they have set jobs. Okay. And he's working at the the pizza? Yeah. National Pizza Company. Okay. And then one day a week he does office work for the school district. But I think he does that from the classroom. I know the biggest thing he always does is the trolley tickets, Excel spreadsheet, but he's done certificates at the end of the year for graduation and stuff for the secretary and he alphabetizes and other activities like that. Yeah. That's awesome. And that's always the same days of the week he's having those two activities or partner program? Yeah, right. Monday, he does the, they go to Walmart and they go to the recreation center and exercise. Then Tuesday, he does the paperwork. Wednesday and Thursday, he does the pizza company. And then Fridays, they go out to lunch. Nice. That's a full week. Does he have any supports that he, I mean, supports that have been put in place for him because of IEP or because of something that you guys requested or that he requested that other students are not getting? Not really. No- any supports in particular for him? Just the supports that everybody, right? Yes. And he's never applied to any post-secondary program? Not yet, I mean, we've been working towards that. We're taking full advantage of what the school system will offer and then we'll go to the next step. There's no need to rush. Yes. Mm-hmm . We want him to be, have to learn as much as he can so that he can take full advantage of if he gets to that post-secondary. And do you think this program is a good fit for ? The T2? Yeah. He's got a caring teacher. They're working hard for him. I mean, I definitely wish there was more always, but I think he's taking advantage of it well and they're treating him well. Yes. Okay. So this is the last question I'm going to stop that before that. Okay. I know that was a lot of talking for you. That's okay.\n",
            "finishAnd so he's currently enrolled in college and when did he graduate high school? Do you remember the year and month? May of 2018. Okay. May of 2018. And what type of diploma did he receive? It was regular diploma. Now, for the rest of the interview, I'll ask about academic programs and employment, since we last spoke in February. So, what does the typical week look like for him? How has he been spending his time lately? Well, he has been on Christmas break, but before Christmas break, it was primarily school and baseball. If he wasn't doing those things, he was watching TV or playing video games pretty much. And how many total hours per week do you think he participates in at school or how many classes or hours of class? He's taking... He took 14 hours of classes. And, so now we'll talk about those class... The academic program specifically. So, you said that it was Cumberland university? Yes. And can you tell me a little bit about the program? I know you said it was a hybrid. So he attended in person class two days a week and virtual class two days a week. For three of his classes, then two of his classes were all virtual.  And what type of did degree is he pursuing? He's pursuing a bachelor of arts in physical education. Great. And I'm assuming this is not a disability specific program? It is not. Correct. And is this a two year or a four year? Sorry, you said bachelor. So that would be four years. It is four years. And his field of study is physical education. And you said he is taking 14 hours, so he's full time. And you said he started this in August. And is he receiving any supports from the program? He receives extra time on tests. That is really about it right now. And do you think that this program is a good fit for him? Yes, I do. And what makes it a good fit? I think that the main things that make it a good fit are that he can play baseball and that it's the right distance from home. It's not too far, but it's far enough for him to need a place to live and live on his own. And do you have any additional comments about this program? No, I don't think so. Okay. And before that, he was still at Columbia State and just wanted to ask a little bit about that one as well. And so, can you tell me a little about that program? Which program are you talking about? Was it Columbia State that he went to before? The place he was at last year? Mm-hmm . Okay. Yeah, so Columbia State, he was pursuing the same degree. He was a little closer to home, so he commuted. A lot closer to home, it was 15, 20 minutes. And he was not able to play baseball there. The main differences. I would say academically it's pretty similar. Cumberland has more of a campus life, but that's been limited by COVID. Columbia State,  school is all commuters so they don't have as much on campus activities. And his area of study was physical education, and how many... What was the average number of classes he was taking per semester? It's the same. He was taking me 12 hours at Columbia State. He's taking 14 hours at Cumberland. Okay. So it sounds like for both of those, about four classes at a time? Yeah. Okay. And- . 14 hours is five classes. Five? Sorry about that. And so full-time student and then, do you remember what month and year he started at Columbia State? Sure, that was August of 2018. Okay. And he left in May of this year? Yes. And I just wanted to make sure, what type of program is it? Is this a two-year or four-year university? Yeah. Columbia State is actually a two-year university. Okay. And so what was his reason for leaving? Did he graduate or choose to leave? He chose to leave for the chance to play baseball really. And was he receiving supports from the program? Yes. And what did those include? It was the same. Pretty much just extra time on tests, plus notes. Not really a note taker, but notes from the teacher. And do you feel that this program was a good fit for him? Yes, I did. And what made it a good fit? I thought the disability office there honestly was a little bit better. Cumberland, it's sort of a balance. Cumberland is making him take more responsibility, which is good. Tried to involve us less, which is also probably good. But Cumberland just was a little bit more... Sorry, the old one in Columbia State was a little more responsive. And do you have any additional comments about this program? No. Okay. And so now, I'm moving on to talking about employment. So he's not currently employed, correct? Correct. But he was working independently in the community. So most recently he was working at the ice cream shop. What was the name again? Something Dairy Dip? Bobby's Dairy Dip. Bobby's Dairy Dip. And can you describe the activity and what he did there? It's a standard. He took orders, worked the cash register, made milkshakes, ice cream sundaes, helped clean a little bit. And did he receive any supports while working there? No. And how did he find this job? How did he end the job? How did he find that job? Find the job. Yeah, so he... Evelyn met the owner of the store through the class she was involved in and he met her at  school and he was interested in helping people with disabilities. That person has subsequently sold the store, but he still... He provides indirect help to Will with the job. He just- That's great. And how many hours per week on average did he work there? I would say, average 15 to 20. Okay. And do you remember when he started working there? He started working there in spring of 2018. Okay. Okay. Spring of 2018, and will he continue to, do you think, work there this summer as well? I'd say there's a good chance. Yes. Okay. And when did he stop working there this summer? Do you remember? Just in August right when he started school. Okay. And do you think that it was a good fit for his skills and interests? Or that it's been a good fit for him? It was a good fit because he liked it, he was motivated. I think it was a challenging job in terms of the speed in which you have to work. He tends to be somewhat slow and meticulous. So it ended because it was seasonal work and he'll likely work there again this summer? Yes. And now about Uber Eats. It sounds like there, his duties included delivering the food. Did he have any other duties at that job? No. Okay. And I'm assuming, just based on what I know about Uber Eats, that he didn't receive supports? Correct. And how did he find this job? The Uber Eats job? That was just something we knew of. It's pretty easy too. Yeah and how many hours a week was he doing it? He never did that more than five or six hours a week. And do you remember when he started? The month and year? It was either December or January of... December of 2019 or January, 2020. Okay. And do you remember when he stopped working there? Pretty much when Bobby's opened in March. Okay and then he started working at Bobby's in March? Yes. Okay. Great. And so do you think that Uber Eats was a good fit for him? Yeah. There's not a lot of growth opportunity. It was just nice in terms of being flexible and... Mainly just being flexible hours and pretty straightforward. And his reason for leaving. Chose to leave to go work at Bobby's, it sounds like. Yes. And has he participated in any other employment activities since we last spoke? No. Okay. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates you would like to give? I don't think so. Okay. Great.\n",
            "finishOkay. And so what does a typical week look like for Will? How has he been spending his time? Well, over the summer, he had a part-time job, and played on a baseball team, and those were his primary activities for the summer. Now he's doing school and baseball, and those are his primary activities. That's great. And so how many total hours a week do you think he spends doing educational activities? Oh, gosh, let's see. I guess he is in class for 14 hours. His homework load last semester, I would say, probably equaled another 14 hours, so maybe 28 hours. 28 hours. Okay. And so you mentioned that he's currently in school. What is the name of the school? Cumberland University. Cumberland University. And can you tell me a little bit about this program? Yeah, I mean, Cumberland is a private school. It's in Lebanon, Tennessee. I think it's about 2000 students, maybe 2,500. They don't have any special programs for autism. They have... But he works at the disability office. They've been supportive. His teachers have been supportive. I think that they are a little bit... I think... What should I say? They probably need more resources. They have something called a student  or something like that, and we've had better luck with that, actually, than the disability office in terms of one-on-one guidance. The disability office team tends to work on making sure you have all your paperwork and all that. Mm-hmm . So the school has a lot of... They're very supportive of rural kids and low-income kids, and kids who , first member of their family who attend college. So they're interested in helping kids succeed. Mm-hmm . Well, that's good to hear about the support that they can give. And is this a degree-seeking program? Is it a what? A degree-seeking program? Oh, yes, it is. Okay. Yes. It's  four-year college. Okay. And what is his area of study? His area of study is physical education. Okay. And what is the average number of classes that he takes per semester? Five classes. Oh, wow. So I imagine that is quite full-time. And do you remember the month and year he started this program? Month and year he started this program. He started it in August of 2020. Okay. And is he receiving supports from the program? He receives extra time on tests. And I would say, if teachers are aware of his disability... I would say have varying degrees of support for his... Mm-hmm . And do you feel like this program is a good fit for him? Yes, I do. And what makes it a good fit? What makes it a good fit? I mean, Will... Yeah.  success. I think that's what makes... That's really good to hear. And do you have any other comments about this program? I don't think so. Okay. And has enrolled in any other academic program since the last time we spoke? Say that again? Any other...? Has he been involved in or enrolled in any other academic programs since the last time we spoke? No. And has he been...? You mentioned that he had a part-time job and that he's not currently working, but he worked over the summer? Correct. And what was the name of the place where he was working? So he worked at Bobby's . This was his fourth summer, I think. Oh, great. And can you describe what he does there? Yeah, he... Whatever people do at ice cream stores. He takes orders, he makes ice cream, he deliver orders to customers. Okay. And does he receive supports while working? He does not. And I imagine he is paid at this activity. How did he find this activity, or this job? . Yeah, he was willing to give Will a job four years ago. Yeah. Mm-hmm . And how many hours per week was he working? I would say that it was 10 to a maximum of around 20. 10 to 20. Yeah. And when did he start that job? So, he started it in summer of 2018. Okay. Would you estimate, like, July? But he only works in the summer. He only works in the summer each year, each summer since then. Okay. And so when did he start working there? Let me take that back. I'm sorry. So in 20... The first two years, 2018 and 2019, he would work for the spring and fall while they were still . Mm-hmm . Since then he's been a full-time . Okay. And so when did he start working there again this year? This year, in May. In May. And when did he stop working there this year? Just last week, August. His last day was August 22nd. Okay. And has this been a good fit for his skills and interests? Yes. And what makes it a good fit? What makes it a good fit? I would say the tasks are very clear and time-sensitive, so he , and I think that's different also. That's great to hear. And you mentioned that it's seasonal, and so he stopped working there recently because he's a full-time student. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And, okay. And has he worked at any other jobs since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And so now we'll move on again to talking about some goals.\n",
            "finishA short assessment, and then I will set up the next survey for you. Okay. We'll just talk about some employment in volunteering activities that he may or may not be involved in. Yes, he's still in high school. Has he ever worked during high school? Yes. He worked last summer. They had a program through the school, it was like a summer seasonal program and he worked at Goodwill Express. Great. Was this part of school programing? It was the summer program. That's awesome. How many hours a week do you estimate that he worked there? PC- I think that was 15 hours a week. Wow. It was a summer job, so ... June and July. June and July. Okay. Of 2019. What kinds of things did he do with the job? Can you tell me a little bit about it? Well, he was working at the donation express center, so he would help people get their things off into the bins. So greet and ... PC connected. So help moving items to the bins? From the car to the bins. And greeting people. Did he receive any supports while working? What do you mean? Someone there, like a one on one person supporting him? Oh yes. The coach from the school was there, walking them through everything. Do you think that this job was a good fit for him? Yes. He liked it. In what other ways was it a good fit for him? Well, because there was somebody there showing him what to do. Did he ever volunteer in the community during high school? No. Let's see, and was a paid activity? Yes. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.\n",
            "finishAnd so just confirming that she graduated high school a few years ago, since she's been involved in college. But what year and month do you remember her graduating high school? She graduated, since she was homeschooled, so she graduated in... Let's see, we moved here in '13... Ah boy, let me think. She, I think she graduated... Ah gosh, you're killing me here. Oh my goodness. Hang on one second. I can tell you real quick. Oh, no problem. Take as much time as you need. We also might have it on record here and I can check and see if we do. Oh, we do! I have June 2015. Is that correct? 2015? Yeah, that's probably right. Perfect. So I will... Yep, that's correct. Just confirming that we have what we have is correct. And we have that she received a regular diploma. Yes. Okay. And so now for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteer activities that she's been involved with since last February. So what does a typical week look like for her? How has she been spending her time? A typical day? A typical week. Oh, a typical week. So just on average or recently? Recently. Okay. Well, let's see. Right now she has not been in school. Oh, you can actually mention when... So we really haven't been doing. Nothing's really been kind of doing much. She's been kind of hanging out and just kind of relaxing. School starts next week. Yeah, you can actually discuss what it would be like if she were in school. Okay. Yeah. A typical week would be... She has Mondays, for instance, she has what's called Backlight Theater. That's her theater group that she's a part of. That's Mondays around lunchtime for about two hours. And then she'll have a class on Monday evening, which runs an hour and a half; that'll be a college course. And then she gets up around 7:30 in the morning and then she has chores. Her and her sister both get up at the same time. And they both have chores that they do equal together. And then usually the morning time, she plays with the dogs and straightens up her room, and straightens the house up and just plays with the dogs, and reads some and plays some games and that kind of thing and hangs out more than anything else. And Tuesdays she'll get up a little bit earlier because she'll have a class that starts at eight o'clock, which will run another hour and a half, and then she'll have other class right after that'll run for an hour and a half. And then she will have, this will be pretty much free. She'll probably eat lunch after that. And then she'll have a class in the evening at six that'll run for three hours. Oh, wow. That's a busy day. Yeah. She'll have a busy Tuesday. But in between she'll do homework and she'll read and she might take a break and play a game or take a nap or something like that to try to decompress. And I encourage her to try not to overload too much and to take breaks quite a bit. So she doesn't overwhelm herself. Wednesdays are... There's nothing for her going on on Wednesdays. So Wednesdays, she'll still get up about 7:30, get up and do her chores. And then she'll, once again, she'll kind of play with the dogs and clean up and just kind of do her thing. And she'll do homework and she'll just kind of hang out around here. And if she's with me, maybe her and I and her sister might go out and hang out some places go to lunch or whatever. And we'll just... This looks like it's going to be kind of a little bit of off day for her. And then, so Wednesday's pretty much open. And Thursdays will be another busy day for her. She'll get up again. She'll have another class at eight o'clock hour and a half, and that'll be a repeat class from Tuesday. And then she'll have another class right after that. Another repeat class from Tuesday. And then she'll have another class from her Backlight Troupe. This will be what they call Backlight Two, which is called writers... Gosh, I forgot what it's called. Write... Basically, it's a writing class where they write plays. And so she'll do that. And that's about a two hour class, and so she'll do that, and then that ends about one o'clock. And so her morning is shot. I mean, that's what her morning is on Thursday. And then so after that, she is more than likely going to eat lunch and she will probably take a nap. Yes, I can imagine. Wow. And then after that, she'll just do a little bit of homework and then eat supper and we'll sit around and watch TV and things like that, because that'll be pretty much her first night off all week. And there are some shows her and her mom and her sister and I all like to watch. So we'll save all those shows probably for Thursday night so we can all watch them together. And then Friday is the day off for pretty much everybody. So there's nothing going on on Friday. So that'll be a day of doing homework and getting out of the house hopefully, and going through the park or just going, grabbing some lunch someplace or just kind of getting out and decompressing for a little bit. And that's pretty much the week. Weekends are just kind of a free for all. She's part of a couple of groups that she hangs out with. Both of them are special needs groups. One of them is a local Franklin Brentwood group with special needs adults. So they get together once or twice a month and they'll go do an activity or something and then go to dinner. And then another one is a group that, I don't think they're associated with Autism Tennessee, but I think they were kind of born out of that. And I think there was an autistic gentleman that... It's an LGBT group that, and they're all on the spectrum. And so Elena identifies as demisexual, I think is what she calls it? That's how she identifies. And so that's another group that she hangs out with and they get together about once a month or so. And they go on outings and they go get dinner and that kind of thing. So that's a weekend for her, and sometimes they do things, sometimes they don't. And sometimes it's just hanging out with us and we do projects around the house and she helps out with that. And she likes working in the yard and she helps mow the grass and rake the leaves and clean up the dog mess in the yard. I'd say so. Yeah, so that's her week, you know. That sounds like she does a lot and I just wanted to ask really quickly, so that class where she writes plays is that through school? No, that is through Backlights. Oh, okay. That's through the Backlight Theater. Yeah, Backlight Theater. And that theater troupe is a theater troupe here in Franklin that consists of all special needs adults. Okay. I'll make a note of that. Okay. And so now we'll talk a bit more about her college program. Is she still at Columbia State? Yes. Okay. And we have that she started there in August of 2019. Is that correct? That is correct. Okay. And, can you tell me a little bit about the program, and what she studies? Well, right now she's just doing general studies for the most part. She started... She thought she wanted to go into graphic design and then reality kicked in when she realized that she needed to be an artist to go into graphic design. So she thought for a while, and she said, \"well, I really like theater, maybe I'll go into theater.\" And then she realized, it's like, \"well, if I want to eat, maybe I need to go into something else.\" And she likes to write. So, I always told her, I was like, \"you know, you can minor in theater. I mean, that's not a problem. I mean, if you want to do that that's great.\" But you know, so now she's thinking about possibly majoring in English, because she does like to write. So she's looking at that. And then she is a looking at... She's taking a computer class this semester, excuse me. And it's a programming class. So we're just waiting to see, she's going to take that and see if that's something that she might be interested in. But yeah, right now it's just basic general studies. She's got her English out of the way. She's taking a communications class this semester, she's taking a Spanish class this semester, she's taking the computer class, she's taking African American literature this semester. So it sounds like four classes? Yeah. So she's taking a full load and then she's taking, let's see computer programming, communication, Spanish, and I think that's it. Yeah. Spanish, communication, computers and African American lit. Yep. And yeah, she's just taking the four classes. Yeah. That sounds like a really interesting course load. And just wanted to make sure, so what type of degree is she seeking? Is she working towards an Associates Degree? Right now she's working towards an Associates. Yeah. She just doesn't know exactly where yet, so... And earlier you mentioned that she did receive support in the form of being able to record lectures? Mm-hmm . Yes. And does she receive, or has she received any other sort of supports? No. Okay. And do you think that this program has been a good fit for her? Yeah, I think so. I think she's enjoying it. Think she's kind of like me and she likes to learn. So yeah, I think she enjoys it. And that's great. And do you have any additional comments about this program? No. No. I guess I wouldn't call program. It's just, you know... I can say it's just... She's just taking general studies right now. So she's just trying to figure out what she wants to do. I mean, I'm 54, I don't know what I want to do when I grow up. That's just kind of where she is, so we're just glad she's able to do it. And so she's doing well and we're proud of her. You know, that's great. I definitely want to make sure I get this down. And just confirming what you mentioned earlier that she's not been involved in a job for a few years. So I think that's all the questions that I have for today. I just want to...\n",
            "finishCollege, you know, it's a two year school and just, you know, it's cheap, it's free and that's pretty much, you know, I think it was something it's a good place for Elena to get started if she wants to continue with a degree. And I think she's still trying to figure out what degree she wants to take. So Great. And is this an autism or disability specific program? No, it is not. And what is her area of study? I think right now she is wanting to do, I think right now she's thinking English. Great! Is what she's thinking about. And, but other than that, I think that's, I think that's right now she's, she's tried or she's was thinking graphic art, and then we had a discussion about that and I'm like, honey, I said, you don't draw at all. So I don't think you has a good route to go. And that's just, she likes English. She likes to write, she like to do that kind of stuff. And then, so I, now we're trying to, you try to get, well, I'm, I'm, I'm letting her take kind of classes. The majority of the classes I'm letting her take on her own. And then I'm kind of pushing her into one class that I think, okay, why don't you try this class and see if you'd like it? And then if you really like this class, then let's go down this path. Like for instance, like computers, she's very good at computers. So she likes, I mean, that gets the whole idea with that. So it's, you know, it's those kind of things that I, we just want to get her to try. She's not afraid to try new things. She just doesn't know what to try. And that's the, that's the problem. And what is the average number of class?\n",
            "finishOkay. So first I would like to get an idea of how she usually spend her time. So what does a typical week look like for her? How is- Right now? Yeah. How has she spending time? Okay. Yeah. Monday afternoons, I'll just kind of give you a broadly. Monday afternoons she has theater rehearsal. She's in a theater group called Back Light Productions. So that's the rehearsal day. Tuesdays she has class in the afternoon, two classes, 1:00 until 4:00. So there's two classes back to back that's on Tuesdays. Wednesdays, she goes in and volunteers for another group called Friends Life. And that is a facility that, it's a day place for adults special needs. And she was there for a while. She went there for two or three years and she wanted to go back and help. And so she goes back in there and she volunteers and helps with their theater group. Okay. Yeah. And then Thursdays is classes in the afternoon again, and Fridays kind of open. Saturdays she has special Olympic swimming. And then we have our dog adoptions that we go to for a dog rescue we work with, and then it's hit and miss, another theater group in town, it's called Studio 10, she volunteers with them. So if they're having a show, she'll go and she works the ticket window. She helps usher. She works the concession stand, that kind of thing. Okay. So currently she is involved with postsecondary education program but she's not working though now. As a paid job. No, she's not. Okay. And then she's not involved in any of the vocational training program as well? No. Okay. No, she wasn't. She did it one time. She went to the voc rehab center in Smirna and went through two separate courses. So if you could tell us how many total hours, average week that she spends participating in post-secondary education or volunteer. Yeah. So postsecondary education would probably about six hours total. Per week. Yeah. It's about an hour and a half class because we're on Tuesdays and Thursdays. So just to round it up a little bit, it'd be about six hours of post secondary education. The volunteer would be, let's see, that would be 1:00 to 4:00. So it's three hours on Wednesday and then usually another, so that's probably about another six to seven hours. So I would say like 12 hours per week. Yeah, probably 12. Yeah. And now we'll talk more about her postsecondary education program. So she's currently involved with the program. What is the name of the school or program? It is Columbia State Community College. Yes. Can you tell me a little bit about this program? Actually, this is not a program. It's a community college. Oh, it's just community college. Yeah. Yeah. It's not really a program. She's taking mainline classes like you or I would take. Her first English class is English 1010 last semester. Now she's taking an intro to film class and then the English 1020 class this semester. Is there or specific majors that she's interested in? No. She just want to more explore. We wanted her to start this because she'll be 26 in March. And we got to think of something. You got to think something to do here. And she's capable of doing it. It's just, she's not, I wouldn't say self-motivated. But once you push her into it, then she does it and she usually enjoys it. So now she is taking two classes. And go back, it's about per semester, she's taking two number of classes. Okay. So she's part-time student then? Yes. Do you remember the month and the year that she started this program? Yeah, she was started, well, like I said, it's not program. Yeah. The school. Yeah. She started the first semester started in August of '19. August of '19 Yes. Is she receiving any supports from the program? You mean like through their disability? Yeah. She gets the opportunity to take the tests with no time limit, take the test in a quiet environment if she just so chooses. And then they give her this  program that is a licensed to her each semester and that's pretty much it. The first couple of tests she took in the fall semester, where she went to the testing center to take the test. And she took them and she did pretty well on them. And she's just like, \"I don't think I need to do that.\" She says, \"Do I have to do that?\" I said, \"Well, you can do whatever you want. I mean, it's just there if you need it.\" And so from that point on, she didn't go and take it. So once she got used to the class and used the routine. Okay. If you have any additional comments about this college program. No. No. Okay. And the vocational program. So she's not participating any of the employment right now? Not at this time. Yeah. But volunteer, yes. Yeah. Okay. So what is the name of the place that she's working at? I mean, she's volunteering at. Yeah. It would be called Friends Life. Okay. Friends Life. And then the activity that she's doing there? She's helping with their theater group. She's not paid here. No. It's volunteering. How does she find this job or activity or? She likes doing theater and like I said, she actually she attended there. Gosh, I don't know how long ago it's been, it's been... My gosh. It's been maybe four years ago. Maybe, but she really liked going there. But she kind of outgrew, her needs changed. And they weren't able to meet what she needed, so it was time to move on and find something else. Okay. So she was involved in with the group in the past? Yes. And then now she wanted to come volunteer. Now she wants to help out because we love that whole program. That's I mean, that program just did wonders for her. My wife's on the board and I volunteer too there. It's just a really great program. How many hours per week she participate in this? Three. Three hours. And then do you remember the month and the year she started this volunteer activity? That would've been probably... Just guessing. I would say probably August of '18. August of '18. Okay. August of '18. Okay. Has she participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteer activity since leaving high school? Except for the current volunteer one. Yeah. No, this has been pretty much it. I mean the other, she volunteers with the dog rescue also. But other than that, no, she hasn't really. She graduated in 2014, 2013. I'm trying to think. Because she actually graduated when she was 19 with the diploma. Could you please describe a little bit more about the dog rescue volunteer activity? Like what did she do there? Yeah. Well that's usually about four hours on a Saturday. The name of the rescue is Ranch to Ridges and we go and we walk the dogs, we take them out of crates and walk them. I'm in charge of the website. So if there's any new dogs that come in to the rescue, she helps with taking pictures and making sure we brush them out. Just whatever needs to be done with the dogs at the time. So yeah, we love animals. So for dog rescue volunteer activity, when did she start? And when did she leave this activity? Just guessing, general. Oh gosh. So we joined this group in 2016. Yeah. And so that would've been probably in, I think around June of 2016. Okay. Yeah. And then she- We're still doing it. Yeah. Yeah. We're still doing it. Yeah. Oh yeah. We're still doing it. So how did she find this activity though? From your parents, yeah. Yeah. It was from us. We adopted a dog. Well, we didn't adopt a dog. We fostered a dog that was pulled from a dog fighting ring. And it's a pit bull. And he just did not have a personality to be a fighting dog. He was a bait dog. And so when we got him, he was thin, he had scars all over him and we just took him. Missing the leg, missing part of a leg, I should say. And we just took him in and fell in love with him and he just stole our hearts. And so he was our first what we call a foster fail. So we were fostering even thinking we were going to get him back to health and somebody else was going to adopt him, but we couldn't give him up. Yeah. So, and that's what started the whole thing. That's a little bit sad. So I was going to ask, so I think I remember that you mentioned a little bit about like Cracker Barrel that she worked. She worked at cracker barrel for two years Like when she was? Gosh, that would've been 2017 into 2018, I think. Okay. 2017. So she's not working here.  She's not working there anymore. At the time was she paid? Yes. That's what bumped her from SSI to SSDI. Okay. What did she do at the time? She was a dishwasher. A dishwasher. Okay. So, but when she worked there, she was pretty much working independently or working with some support. Was there any support? There was very minimal support at the beginning that she got from voc rehab. Just to kind of get her feet going and make sure she knew what she was doing. Then after that it was done. That was it. I guess it's pretty much independent though. Yeah. Okay. how did she find that job? Through voc rehab Through voc rehab. And how many hours did she work at the time? Oh my gosh. Per week. I'm going to say 15 to 20. Okay. 15 to 20. And then she started from 2017. Yeah. To about the end of 2018. Just for about an year. Yeah. What was the reason that she leave this? Well, she was tired because they were having her work the day shift or the open shift. So it's more like she choose to leave. She chose to leave. Yeah, she really did. She was like, \"Yeah, I can't.\" And it was taking away our weekends. And she would even ask for particular weekends off and they were constantly denying her. Adan she would give them enough time and yeah, they would just totally deny her taking off and it was getting to a point where we couldn't even take the family vacation. And they wouldn't give it up, so we sat down as a family and we talked about it and that was the best choice. Okay. I guess that's it. I mean, she has a lot of different experiences as she's 26. We have tons of different questions. I mean, if she is high school student, we'll just only ask, what are you doing right now? and that's it, but right now seems like she has a lot of good stuff. And now the another section we are going to ask is... So the goal payment scaling. Oh, why? This is not... Can I really quickly?\n",
            "finishSo just wanted to double check and confirm that he is out of high school and he is in a community college program. That's correct. Okay. And so during COVID, did his high school plans or graduation date change at all? No. Okay. And so when did he graduate high school? It would've been the fall before COVID started. The fall before COVID. Okay. So that would be August of 2019? I think so. Yeah. Okay. And what type of diploma did he receive? I'm not sure if it's normal. He did receive the standard education, wasn't special ed or anything like that. Okay. Great. And so for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs and vocational activities that he's been involved in since last February of 2020. So first I'd like to get an idea of how he normally spends his time. So what does a typical week look like for Bennett? How has he been spending his time? He has virtual class four days a week. He prepares early, so he'll get up hours before, he got a 10 minute commute if he were to drive in. He'll get up hours early to pack his lunch and put himself together. Get home- Yeah. Well, it's a great habit too. I think, specifically during COVID his friend relationships again, I think largely due to his fear of community transmission, he used to walk a lot. He used to go to, there's a record shop in town. He would walk to the record shop. He had one or two friends that he was close to, that all that just ceased. So he did a lot more on the computer. So he's become good at Skype. He's become good at some role player games where they could actually gather virtually like in Minecraft and things like that. So he'll spend a good bit of time on there. We try on any given day to give him time where he's in charge. So like he's got two first grade siblings, so we'll find a reason to go get gas or to go get a gallon of milk and ask him to be in charge of things. I think he takes that really seriously and he really proud of himself in that sense. He makes his own meals, which is great. The  is he won't eat what you make him, and he's very critical to make him. So that's kind of a double edged sword there, but he's very independent. He's got probably a five meal rotation that he goes through, but that's all he ever wants. So he's really kind of thrilled up there. But yeah, he just a largely digitally since February. I think once he realized broadly what the threat of COVID was he really kind of turned into himself and was really focused on not getting it. And I think one of the things he talked a lot about was not giving to anybody else either. He would go to his grandparents house pre-COVID and play drums and sit. And he stopped all that. So I think he's really, really turned in, hoping to get through this current pandemic. On the weekend, no different than his day off at school. He really doesn't have any outside routines or anything like that that would differentiate those from his off day from school. And so how many hours per week do you think he spends with school? 20 hours engaged actively and probably another 10 to 15 prepping or working on it. Wow, that's awesome. And so he is currently enrolled in school. And what is the name of the school or program that he's enrolled in? He is at Columbia State Community College, and I don't know the exact name of the program, but it is like film technician doing light and camera and audio work. I wish I knew the name of the program, but I don't know. Film technician. Yeah. I think he's taken to writing and things like that for a long time, and I think he's just sees it as a potential outlet in the future. And so can you tell me a little bit about this program? Well, I'll talk about the real part as opposed to the theory part, because it would be quite a bit of living lab work where it would be let's actually set up the light, let's actually do this. But because of COVID it's become split where instead of the classwork, every other day they had to watch it on computer. So initially they were doing some actual camera work, camera set up, starting the nature of sound, starting the nature of light, how it interplays. And it's really been a pretty hands on experience for them even though it's been virtual in a lot of ways. They do get some time on campus every week to dig into it. But it's designed to be a very hands on tech program, an old school internship or guided study and it's had to evolve in this year. But it was designed to be very hands on and really a first learner kind of deal. So you said it was designed to be hands on like an internship with guided learning. Yeah. I imagine in the seventies, if you wanted to be a mechanic, you just followed a mechanic around. I think that's how we're supposed to be, but they've had to do a lot of adjustments due to the digital learning space. So got a lot of adjustments to COVID. And so you mentioned that a lot of it's virtual learning, but did you say he does still get a little bit of time on campus during the week currently? Yes. Yeah. At least one day on campus. Okay. And what is the average number of classes that he's taking per semester? So the way it's set up, it's done as a cohort. So the whole group moves together. So it's not clearly delineated classes or anything like that. It is the quote unquote the program as they go. So unfortunately I can't give you an answer to that. So takes it as a cohort rather than classes. Yeah. So we're not doing light study for the next six weeks, it's they do a little light, then they do a little bit of camera work and then they do a little bit of rig set up and a little bit of site construction. So they're taking small bites out of the apple as they go, instead of doing all in once in one class sitting. And, and is he a full-time or a part-time student? I think technically it's full-time, the two year full-time program. Okay. And do you remember the month and year that he started this program? I think it was August of '19. Okay. And you mentioned earlier that he had been receiving supports from the program, but now no longer is. Yeah. We talked to the professors and tried to work out some more clear understandings of Bennett's learning style and the accommodation that'll help him be successful, more written work, longer time to produce, things like that. But because a lot of that actual work and assessment went away. I think the grading is become very gracious for everybody. So a lot of those things haven't been necessary or even applicable because the testing's structure and formats changed. So a lot of these accommodations haven't been necessary. And what kind of accommodations did he have? You said having longer time to take tests and written work? Yeah. So I think longer time, follow up options if there was anything missed, greater access to the professor to ask questions. And then everything done by a written work so that he could have time to think about it and fully articulate his ideas. And then you said access to the professor to talk to them. Is that one that you mentioned? Yeah, absolutely. Yes ma'am. Okay. Okay. And you said that they just haven't really been necessary due to the changed format of the classes? Correct. Okay. And so do you feel that this program has been a good fit for him? Absolutely. Yeah. I think for a lot of reasons, first among them an ego boost to be part of something. I think that's something that even through high school might have been missing. So because of the cohort format, it's the same dudes and the same gals. So I think he's really been able to excel in that. I think it's been really good fit. Okay. So it sounds like he's found a program with a sense of belonging. Correct, I think so. Okay. And do you have any additional comments about this program? None currently. Okay. And it sounds like he hasn't been involved or enrolled in any other program since we last spoke that this has been the only one? Correct. Okay. And you mentioned earlier that he's not currently working, but has he been involved in any vocational activities since we last spoke? We'll pay him in name to babysit sometimes, but other than that, no. Okay. And what about any volunteering? Has he been involved in that? Yeah, I think he fostered a cat. I'm not sure if that qualifies, but because that was just in the house, but he did. His sister's very active in that community and he volunteered and fostered a cat. That's so great. That's so sweet. And is there anything else that you'd like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share? No. He intends, after the internship, to pursue full-time employment. So when his program ends and he gets through his internship, he's looking to parlay that into something in that field or at the very least seek gainful employment full time somewhere else. Okay. And this program ends. Okay. Well I'll stop the recording.\n",
            "finishAnd so earlier you mentioned that she is no longer in high school and she's no longer receiving any sort of services through the school system. Right. And you mentioned she graduated in 2020, correct? Right. So now I'd love to know about what she's been involved with since high school. And since the last time we spoke in January, but first I'd like to get an idea of how she spends her time. So we'll talk about activities she's participating in a typical week. So what does a typical week look like for her? How has she been spending her time? Well, like I said, the big piece is playing video games. Before COVID she did participate in some Autism Tennessee events that they had. They had a monthly board game. We didn't get there every month, but when you actually came in and played board games, now she wouldn't talk much, but she would play the game. So that was some interaction I have to tell you since COVID her, it's, everything's a house. I mean, I'll take her out to her appointments or allergy shots. She's kept up with all her, like dental and eyeglass and things like that. But as far as social interaction with kids her age, nothing. They went to Zoom on some of the things they do and she had no interest to do Zoom whatsoever. So it's time for her to leave the cocoon a little bit. And, okay. And is she currently enrolled or has she been enrolled in an academic program since the last time- No. You spoke in January. Okay. And then is she currently participating in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities? Not at the moment. Hopefully as of August 16th. Okay. She'll be in. Her internship on August 16th. Okay. And that's through Project Search. Okay. And just to ask like a few questions on that. So you mentioned that she will be getting supports through that program and. Yes. How many hours a week do you think she'll be working there? Well, it's not just work. They actually have an ac. I think the first, if they divided into three periods, it goes like a school year from August through May and they've divided it into three sections. And the first, I don't have the calendar in front of me, I want to say the first five or six weeks is classwork. I don't know that they don't do some other things too, but that's the focus. And then they moved them to, I guess, based on their assessment, which I don't exactly know how she did, into another second thing, where they do one of the things they felt like they did the best. And then the other section, one of the second thing they did the best. So maybe there's three things. I'm kind, I wish I'd brought the calendar, but I don't have it with me, but in anyways, it's divided up that they have classwork time where I guess they work on some of the social skills and things. Like he said, they even apparently at Vanderbilt, you you have a shuttle or something. He said they learn how to kind of use that. And they talk about other things, that I guess, getting along with people, how to handle problems, all these things. They're so important. But so it, I think the classroom kind of deals with that. Not just the particular job they're doing, we're going to have them do, but. And do you know if she'll- Anyway. Oh, sorry about that. Do you know if she will be paid at her internship? No, it is not a paid internship. Okay. Okay. Great. And how did you find Project Search? Sure. And I cannot remember which one, because sometimes the same person posts on different things. It was either an Autism Tennessee posting or a Span Tennessee posting that was put up. Somebody put up. Is that stand Tennessee? Yeah. It's capital S P A N hyphen capital T N Oh Span. Thank you. Okay, great. And so now we're going to switch gears a bit and talk about goals.\n",
            "finishSo he's still in high school. Has he ever worked during high school? Yes. And how many jobs has he worked? One. And was this through high school programming? No. And did he receive payment at this job? Yes. And where does he or did he work? He worked as a counselor in training at Oak Hill Day Camp. Oh, counselor at day camp. And so how did he find this job? He attended the camp, and his brother attended the camp. And his brother transitioned to be a counselor in training, and he just sort of followed in that same footstep. And how many hours a week did or does he work at that job? Let's see.  I think it was like 25 to 30 hours. Wow. That's awesome. And do you remember the month and year he began working at that job? Let's see. It was... Let's see. So I'm going to say, I think it was June 2019. Okay. And do you remember when he stopped working there? End of July 2019. End of July? It was for the summer. Mm-hmm . Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about the job? Like what he did there, exactly? Yeah. He assisted the camp counselors. So he would do anything from helping to clean tables after lunch, to helping to set up the yard games, or setting out toys, or taking out trash and helping facilitate the games with the kids... What else? Helping with arrival and dismissal, ... Yeah, it sounds like he did a lot. Mm-hmm . And did he receive any support while working there? No. And do you think it was a good fit for him? Yes. And why was it a good fit? Well, one, he was familiar with all the people, because he had attended the camp. So it was just a familiar surrounding. He already knew the schedule, he already knew the activities, so none of that was foreign. Two, the tasks that he was asked to do, he could do. So he wasn't asked to do anything that was beyond his ability. And I would also say that they were just a very reinforcing group of people, so they were very positive. So that was good. Great. And did he ever volunteer during high school? No. I mean, he was voluntold to do a couple of things, but I wouldn't say that he actually volunteered. Okay. I have to put that as a note. That's great. Okay, great. So that one is actually complete.\n",
            "finishOkay. And so I just wanted to confirm that she is still in high school and receiving services through the school system. And so have her high school plans track changed since the last time we spoke? No. And when is she planning on exiting the school system and not receiving services from the school system anymore? Okay. So, next year is going to be the 2021-2022. So, then, I think she'll be there until the 2024-2025 school year, I think. So, next year, she'll be a senior and then I think she gets to stay there for three more years, I think, is what that would be, so like the year that she turns 21 is when she she will...I'm wanting to say 2024-2025 school year. Okay. So would that be like exiting around May of 2025? I believe so when she would be 21 years old. Yeah. And you mentioned that she's not currently working, but working on skills in her class. Yeah. And this is just something that we ask to everybody. Why is she not currently working? Well, she goes to school full time. Yeah. That's what I imagined. Yeah. She's there during regular school hours every day, so. And you said that she has not worked and left any jobs since we last spoke? No. And what about volunteering in the community since we last spoke? No. Okay and is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share with us today? No. I don't know if you asked me. I think you did ask this and I said, no. It doesn't really matter. It really hasn't affected her, but at the very beginning, when you were talking about like changes, I guess, medically with she or me, I was diagnosed with several autoimmune disorders back around Christmas, but it has, I guess, I didn't think to say anything because it hasn't...like I am not working because of it or anything like that. She and I have talked about it. So, she's aware of that. I've explained like what it means, like what the symptoms are for these things, but it certainly doesn't mean I'm dying or anything like that. So, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and Sjogren's syndrome and psoriatic arthritis. I'm the only one who takes care of like everything in the house and we live on an acre and a half and like I do all of those things. So, she sees me like, I get up and move around a little bit and then I'll say, \"Oh, I'm going to have to go lie down for about 10 minutes.\" And then I'll pop back up and go do things. So, she hears me talk about that and I also had to start a medication for polycystic ovary syndrome, which is an injection that type 2 diabetics take. So, I'm not diabetic, but my body thinks it is. So, anyway and she has a very sweet little friend who's type 1 diabetic. So, she was very concerned with that. I told her how mine is different than his because she knows how serious his is as that he very likely cannot live as long as a typical human being...as what typical people might live to be and she talks about that a lot about him. It's her teacher's son actually and they're very close because the little boy walks over from the elementary school and, sometimes if he's not being well, he'll come over and his mom has to do pumps, things with the pumps in his arm and everything. It's funny because she knows all about it. She can tell me like the name of the pump. How high? Yes. She knows what blood sugar is, what amount is way too high and what's too low. She told me all this stuff. She really pays attention to those things. So, when I started having to take ozempic, I have to do an injection like once a week, she seemed a little concerned about that and I explained that what my issue is very different from his and so I've had some changes like that, but none of them are...right now, I'm managing them fine and I'm just learning like what I need to do and how it all works and how it works into my life and everything, but it's not something where I've missed big chunks of work over it or anything like that. So, I guess that is kind of different. I honestly didn't even think to say anything about that at first. So, that's kind a different, but, and we've had conversations about it, so she's aware of it and she notices it, but it hasn't, at least not that I can tell, been traumatic by any means or anything like that, so yeah. Okay. Thank you so much for speaking with me...\n",
            "finishTalk about some programs that you've been doing, or some jobs that you've had, and I'll see what you thought of those. All right. Okay. So first is what you do now at Paul Mitchell? And I just want to confirm that you've been going since May? Yes, so I've been going since May 12th. And they're a really fantastic school. I should have chose them years ago. They're very, very nice, and there is a lot of opportunities they offer there, even in this climate now with COVID, I'm planning to try to make into the Dean's list, and I had to join two clubs, you can say, one of them is creatives or design, which is like, the artistic makeup, and the other one is skin design, which is more focused on the skincare, and the reason why I'm doing that is because to be part of the Dean's list, I have to take two  both of those to be part of the Dean's list. Cool. So it sounds like you're really motivated. Yeah. I have. I'm thinking of different ideas. It is scary a little bit or intimidating because a lot of things is going on, but just say my primary goal in the field as a statistician is oncology is the esthetician where I would perform certain facials, or special types of massages for oncology patients. My gosh. That's awesome. Yeah. Now the thing about... They don't Paul Mitchell does not teach Oncology stuff. Oncology esthetician is another level. It's like, \"You're a doctor, but what kind of doctor are you going to be? Are you going to be a botanist or is it dermatology? It's like another level. So I need extra schooling on that. But other than that, there's being oncology aesthetician, I'm thinking maybe be a freelance makeup artist, do weddings or proms, or I like to do older women. I prefer to do older women just to cheer them up. And my last one I'm really studying on that is to create my own makeup line. That's awesome. Yeah. So I'm really studying about the ingredients and what equipment do I need and how do I start? Again, one of my classmates, she sells her own lip glosses. So she told me, just take it a little bit out of time, but I know how to bake, I enjoy baking. So I'm very picky of what ingredients I need to take and the amount. So I'm really, really doing heavy research on what kind of  or dye should I use and all that. So I'm really trying to make it very, very careful. That's awesome. So it sounds like this has been a great fit for you. And I was just wondering if there were any other comments that you wanted to make about the program itself? And if not, that's totally fine, and we can move on to the next one. Paul Mitchell is very accepting. They're very... They always ask students they're more progressive with the student than other colleges or schools. And I highly encourage people to go to a program where whether six months or nine months, program where you can immediately get a job right after that. I should have chosen this right after high school. Yeah. That's awesome. It sounds like you really found your calling. Yeah. And I love what I call... My sister classmates of my sister estheticians. That's amazing. Yeah. Cool. So the next one that we'll talk about is Gallatin, Voc Rehab or the job readiness program, and I just want to confirm some dates that I have. I have that you did this for the month of January? Yes. And- And March I believe. And March? Yeah. That could be it. So you did it from January until March? Yeah. The Gallatin, Voc Rehab. Yes. And so for this one, did you feel that this program was a good fit for you? It did. I did not have a good... The last few months of 2019. Wasn't good. So when I came back home, it was like a training wheel. It was like going back into the water of working. It was basic, it was easy, I already get the gist of it. They were very, very nice, I did enjoy myself. I highly recommend to anybody with disabilities as a tryout to see what it feels like to get a job, and what happened was, the reason why I quit was, I was unsettled with the money, and I was trying to apply to other jobs, but then that's when the COVID shutdown started, and I just decided not, you know what? I think the job is not going to do anything. I don't think people are going to accept me because of the skills, and also the COVID 19 situation, so that's where I started school. But again, the staff are really nice people, my coworkers, they were very, very nice. Everybody was very respectful. Yeah. I'm just going to write that down. Yeah. I'm glad that was a good experience for you too. Was there anything else that you wanted to add about it? And if not, that's completely fine. And we can move on to the next one. One, again, this is if you're trying to recommend people with disabilities that want to start a job, they do mini classes. We have to clock out for those who don't get paid for doing that. They use mini classes. Basically is how to make a resume? Or what do you expect in an interview? To me, it was elementary because I know what they're talking about and everything, but it did help, or I did help my coworkers there how to make that resume a bit better? Or how do you dress to impress at an interview? Or practice what to say as eloquently as you can in the interview, because I do cross up my words or jumble my words a lot. So I help them what to say, so that was fun. Yeah, it sounds like a really good opportunity to learn for sure. Yeah. Yeah. I did enjoy helping people in those types of classes. And so when you left, you said it was because of COVID 19 and that you wanted to apply to other jobs anyway? Yes. Okay. So I'll just write that down. Okay. And the next one is this was Volunteer State, and I have here that you were there from August 2015 until October 2019? Yes. And was that a- Vol State? ... Good fit? Yeah, go ahead. To me, no. Vol State is a good school. I am not a college person. I hate going to school, and even for community college, it wasn't for me. Paul Mitchell, they're more hands on while Vol State is a traditional community college, and I just hate bookwork, and there are some teachers I wasn't comfortable with. I only have one really good teacher that I recommend to anybody but other than that, I am not the college type. I love to learn. However, I needed to be hands on, I can't sit down. I really can't sit down and read a book, I fall asleep or it goes into one ear and out the other Yeah. It just was not for me. And so you mentioned your reason for leaving, so what exactly was your reason for leaving though? Did you ultimately choose to leave the program? Or were you asked to leave the program or was there something else? I left in my own accord, basically, I had a mental breakdown and I'm just saying, \"You know what? This is not for me.\" \"I don't know what to do.\" Back then, I did not want to, I don't know what I want anymore. I don't know what to do. I hate college. I hate going to school. It's not for me. I'm wasting my time. I'm wasting my money. I'm wasting energy. Yeah. Well, it's a good thing then that you found something else that you like better. Yeah. And again, I call this the great American lie where everybody said... I was conditioned like that since high school, where everybody says, \"You have to go to college.\" Well, there's people such like myself, and other people, college is not for them. And it should be encouraged, how people are encouraged to sign up for, either Vol State or to Belmont because I work with my hands. Sorry. I work... No problem. All right. Hold on. Sorry. No problem. I work with my hands.  right away. Sorry. That's okay. I work with my hands. I work on my feet. I work better doing. I don't... Excuse my French, but I really don't like to sit on my ass all day and read a damn book, because to me, it doesn't apply to reality. Yeah. Well, I definitely have some friends who are in the same boat and they've done way better in those types of programs, like beauty school or learning a trade than they would've in college. Yeah. I love to learn, but why the hell am I going to do... When am I ever going to do math equations if I'm fixing somebody's eyebrows? Yeah, No, I agree. And I personally don't like math equations much either. No, I'm cool with math, it's just to me, okay, this is what I have to learn. Do I use it in real life? Yes or no? Yeah. Yeah. And so now we're going to talk about some other things that you did. So it looks like The job readiness program, and we already talked about this. So I'll add the notes about that, looks like these are repeated. Okay. One moment. And Let's see. So for the job readiness program, on average, how many hours per week did you participate? Do you think? I don't remember the job readiness program. Sorry. That was the incorrect one. Let me check on that again. I scrolled down too far. Sorry about that. Okay. The Voc Rehab. Nevermind, I have the dates there. I had some technical difficulties, but yes, how many hours per week did you participate there, if you can remember? I know it's like seven or eight o'clock in the morning to two in the afternoon, five days a week. So like 22 hours, I might be wrong, but it was part-time. And how many classes would you describe yourself as taking? On what? what do you mean? Or was it not really an environment where you took classes, or you said you had the mini classes? Yeah. There were mini classes. They did it like once or twice a week. Okay. So let's see. Okay. So I'll add that note. Okay. Let's see. And you said 22 hours per week And you chose to leave. Okay. And the next one is Amazon warehouse, and I just wanted to confirm those dates. I have it as around mid-November of 2017 to mid-November of 2019. Are those dates approximately correct? Yes. And was that a good fit for you? Yes and no. Would you- Here's the positive trade for Amazon. I had really good pay, I had flexible hours, and I have really good benefits, and I had really awesome coworkers. I worked at two different warehouses, the first one to me was the best, while the second one, everything went downhill because first, that warehouse was brand new, something always happened, basically, all the rules that applied to the previous warehouse didn't apply there and everything was short staffed and it was just total chaos. But when I started to do school, I switched to midnights because I have to do three nights a week, basically 8:30 in the evening to four o'clock in the morning, three nights a week. So 8:00 PM to 4:00 AM. Yes. Gosh. Yeah. I was happy, I did have really nice coworkers, but basically, it's just realizing about my life, where's it going? And things got too much. Amazon, as a warehouse associate or a worker there, they track your actions. We scan these boxes, and they track how many boxes you scan per hour. And we do have a limit or a minimum level of how many boxes you can scan per hour. However, they redesigned the whole system, which made it hard for a lot of us, especially for short petite women because we have these bags and we can't reach it. And they try to make us do it faster, basically like a robot, and they're setting these bars high on us, and they even tried to do awards, and I asked them, \"If I joined this club before I do this, what do I get in return?\" And I was told nothing. So what's the point if I'm not getting anything? It's just, they're treating us like cattle, and there were some workers there that were starting to bully other workers, and I just had enough of it. And also the environment. It was mostly during the summer that it started to really go downhill, and the thing about the warehouse, it didn't have air conditioning, so- Gosh. ... we were in like a hot box. One person collapsed, one person had a seizure. My gosh. That's awful. One that really hit me the most was, somebody tried to threaten one of my managers like a death threat, and they said that we're on lockdown. However, It was towards the end of our shift, and they told us that the lockdown and we can't go out, but people from the next shift is going in, and our manager just as we're technically still on lockdown, but you all can go home, and I'm just looking at it's like, \"what the?\" \"What?\" So everything just went crazy, and I just couldn't take it because I just couldn't breathe basically. Yeah. No, that sounds terrible, that makes me not want to ever shop at Amazon again. Big Bezos will always have his money. Yeah. Again, Amazon, they treat certain workers the best, while they treat the lowest of the low, such as I am the least. And they think they have a solution for everything, but it still doesn't make it work. And they try to recreate different systems of how we do our job and it either doesn't make any difference, or it makes it a lot more harder than it should be. And they never give you a straightforward answer. Yeah. So I'm assuming that you chose to leave that you quit? Yeah. I'm just like, \"You know what? I'm going home, I don't care.\" Yeah. Gosh. Well, I'm really glad that you're out of there and onto better things. Yeah. There are some parts of it where I did enjoy the job, but we had these crazy moments, and crazy people coming in and we're like, \"You know what? We're fucking out.\" \"We're just going home.\" Yeah. Let's see. So I'm just going to write that down. Okay. I just want to make sure I got everything you said, because it was very eloquent and detailed. Yeah. Because I got them both out of Amazon or basically Amazon chewed me up and spit me out. I'll write that down too. Wait, chew me up spit me out? Yeah. No. Unless you're uncomfortable with that, but- No, I'm just like, \"Oh, okay.\" . I don't care. We're the only ones who are going to see this. Okay. And so for the next one, about the dog training, so how did you find that job? Craigslist. And about- Yeah. Go ahead. And about how many hours a week did you work? Shoot. It was a full-time job. So like 40 hours a week? The highest is 46 on that job. Okay. And do you remember when you started it, and stopped working there? I started working there at the summer of 2016, and I stopped working there at the summer of 2017. Okay. So about a year. And would you say that maybe you'd estimate starting and stopping around July? Yes. Okay. And so did you think that was a good fit for you? That job? I got a lot of mixed feelings. Would you maybe more towards yes. Or to towards, towards now? I loved the job because I get to see with dogs and stuff, but I had to leave because my boss was very abusive. So that's a conflicting question, but all in all I had so much fun, I had awesome coworkers, I loved seeing the dogs, I loved taking care of the dogs and talking to people, I learned how to train dogs, my proudest moment there was helping deliver puppies, and watching them grow up and stuff, but my boss, It just got, my boss was so abusive and so cruel to me that we had a huge fight and I had a huge fight with his wife and I had to leave. And then later after that, I found out that my coworkers left because he threw an oil can at one of them. My gosh. And my biggest regret is... Hold on. Sorry, my dogs. No problem. My biggest regret is not to report him because first it was an independently owned business, and I didn't understand that you could go to the department of labor. I thought you needed evidence and all that. So that's my biggest regret is to not turn him in because their practice is still working, they're still practicing the kennel, and that's my only biggest regret is not to report them. Yeah. And I can understand that, but it's also just really good that you got out of there and got to safer places. Yes. And yeah, I learned better skills, and I know who I am as a person and as a worker, how to not stand for something. So it's bittersweet, but I have to learn. Okay. So it sounds like the job itself was a good fit. It was just the environment itself was not. Yeah. Okay. And we've got a few more to discuss. It seems like you were really busy. Yeah. You can sing that Johnny Cash song, I've Been Everywhere. Man. You really have. So it looks like we've got, let's see, working in a clothing store? That was after the dog kennel. That was July to November 2017. It was in a few months. So July 2017 to November 2017? Yeah. I used to work at route 21, and I had nice coworkers, but it was not a good fit for me. It was at the mall and people were just nasty at the mall, so. Yeah. And how did you find that job? I just did it out of... The mall, I lived nearby the mall, just like a good 10 minutes away from it, and I just thought like, \"You know what? Let me do something else besides doing draw .\" And let's see, and how many hours per week did you work there? 22. I was part-time. And you said it was not a good fit because people were nasty at the mall? Yeah. And retail was not for me. And so you quit and- Right after when I quit, I moved to Amazon. And was there anything else that you wanted to mention with the circumstances for you quitting? No. It was just not a good fit. Yeah. Okay. And so I think this is the last one working at a pizza shop. Yeah. Whew. I think I just did it at 2016. That was it. It was another part-time job during school. So 20 ish, 22 hours per week? Yes. And do you remember what months? Just say August through to December. Okay. 2016. And do you remember how you found that job? It was near my house. It was in my hometown, the pizzerias closed. I was a dishwasher, so it was just the first job for everybody. It was all right, but looking back, it was just a job, nothing really significant. It's just where to start. Okay. So let's see. So you said it was... Sorry, you might have already said this, but I was filling in some information, so I just want to confirm, would you say overall it was a good fit or was not? It was not it. Yeah. And what were the circumstances around you leaving? I was just tired of the job, and I just wanted to focus more on school. Mm-hmm . Okay. Awesome. So that one is done.\n",
            "finishShe has been out of the school system, correct? Like out of the high school system? 2015. She graduated high 2015. Okay. And was that in May 2015? Yes. Okay. And what type of diploma did she receive? High school diploma. Regular. Okay. And so for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about some academic programs, employment and volunteering activities that she's attended since June 23rd, 2020. So first I'd like to get an idea of how she normally spends her time. So we'll talk about a typical week. What does a typical week look like for Cassandra? How has she been spending her time? She's been home isolated. She is available and willing to go to her job. The place is about a 10 minute ride from our house, 10 minute ride. She has a car and she drives. And at first, when she was newly hired, she went 11:00 AM to 7:00 PM and she kind of hung around. And then after about three weeks, it was determined that this is useless to hang around with no clients. So they have online client database and she receives the text of when the client is booked. So she has a two hour lead. So if somebody gets booked now they give her a two hour cushion so she can get herself ready and get up there. So every day you're waking up and you're wondering if anything's going to happen and then it could happen. And then it's happy because you can get your clothes on and go and do what you want to do as far as a job. And then some days she does have several clients, typically Fridays and Saturdays are good days. So the clients are available and they book. So she might have maybe three, two to three to four appointments and that's a very good day for her because you get up and you have at least a six hour structured period of a job. Mm-hmm . On Sunday, she's very she's diligent and she comes to church on Sunday. She has done Instacart, which again, I didn't realize you have to wait to get your assigned they call it batches. So every day you're waiting, you're wondering. Okay. It's not like you have to get up at 6:30 and you have to be somewhere at 8:30. Every day, it's like you drag yourself awake and you wonder if anything's going to happen. And then if it happens, you can respond. So with Instacart, she has to wait and look at her phone and if she gets a order, she'll go over to the public, then she'll do the shopping and she leaves it there. She has chosen not to drive it to a person's house. They just leave it. Shop and then they leave it at the store. And so, and how many total hours during an average week, does she, you spend participating in her vocational activities, generally? Oh, I would say six to eight. Six to eight. Let's say 10. It's very, it's one fourth of what it should be. Okay. And so now we'll talk about some school programs that she attended after high school since June of 2020. So I know you said that she's not currently enrolled, but has she been enrolled in an academic program since June of 2020? Right? She was in  cosmetology program that started February and she finished in October. So February. So she graduated from that program. Okay. So February to October. And can you tell me a little bit about the program? I believe it's 600 hours of classroom and skills to have the teaching to take your state licensure for a esthetician. So she's a licensed esthetician. Mm-hmm . Okay. And so this sounds like it was kind of like a trade school. It's a trade school. It's vocational school. Okay. It's cosmetology. Mm-hmm . Okay. And her area of study was esthetician? Yes, skincare. And what's the number of classes on average that she was taking per semester? It's not set up like that. You had to complete 600 hours. I don't know how they record it, but it, the training program is considered 600 hours of training. And was she a full-time or part-time student? Full-time. Okay. And you mentioned earlier that her reason for leaving was that she graduated? Correct. Okay. And then became licensed? Yes. Okay. And was she receiving supports from the program? No. And why wasn't she receiving supports? She did not need them. Okay. And do you think that this program was a good fit? Yes. Okay, great. And what made it a good fit? It's her passion. Okay. And do you have any additional comments about this program? No. Okay. And so now we'll talk about some vocational activities that she has been doing since the last time we spoke. And so you've mentioned that she is working as an esthetician right now, correct? And what is the name of the business? Yeah, she has. What's the name of the business where she's working? Sun. S-U-N's up. U-P. Sun's up. And can you describe this activity? The business is tanning salon. She is the skincare person. They have a massage therapist and they have a nail technician. Mm-hmm . And is she receiving supports from this program? No. Okay. And is she currently paid at this activity? I imagine, yes. She is paid, yes. And how did she find this job? Word of mouth. Word of mouth. And how many hours a week do you think she's working here? 10. 10? Okay. And do you remember the month and year she started working here? Probably March. March of this year. Okay. And do you think it's been a good fit for her skills and interests? Excellent fit, yes. Oh, that's great. What makes it a good fit for her? She is doing the licensed aesthetics work that she is trained to do. Mm-hmm . They just don't have enough clients. And do you have any other additional comments about this program? She's very happy there. She likes the people, the physical building where she works is very nice. She has all the supplies she needs. They asked her what she wants to charge for her services and she made that recommendation. So she's getting the fair wage of what a person, somebody who's starting out in this business would receive. That's wonderful. It's just that not enough customers. Mm-hmm . And so earlier you mentioned that she does Instacart. I was wondering about how many hours a week she does that? I would say two. Two. Okay. And earlier you mentioned that for Instacart, she goes and picks up the groceries and like leaves them at the grocery store for people to pick up. Right. Somehow you get this list of groceries and she goes into the grocery store, does that shopping and they bag it and then she leaves it there. So they have a certain area where the customer would pick it up. You could drive it to their person's house. She doesn't do that. She just does the shopping and leaves it in the bag at the store. Mm-hmm . And does she currently, does she receive supports for this activity? No. And I imagine she's paid at this activity? I'm not sure what you get when you get something. And this is something that she's currently doing? I'm encouraging her to do it. I don't think it's plentiful. The amount of work that she has but she'll do it. And how... It's not a joy, it's not a good fit. It's just not to fill her time. Yeah. And how did she find this job? I think it's just common knowledge Instacart. Mm-hmm . And do you remember the month and year that she started? March this year. March? Okay. And you mentioned that it's not a good fit for her. Why is it not a good fit for her? Doing somebody else's food shopping is boring. Mm-hmm . Yeah, It's just there, it's an opportunity. It's just there. And do you... It is a good fit for her because, I'll say this. It is a good fit for her because she knows how to use the phone, she can drive a car and she knows how to food shop. So it does fit her skillset. Mm-hmm . On the other hand, she doesn't want to do it. She just does it because you have to do something besides laying down and it's readily available. Okay. And do you have any additional comments about this job? No. And has she participated in any other jobs since the last time we spoke? Well, happy day today, five o'clock today. She is an interview downtown at a retail location. Okay, great. Yeah, that's great. This would be in her line of work. It's in a upscale makeup, retail place. That's awesome. And so upscale, makeup place. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share with us? Cassandra is willing to work plus 40 hours if the opportunity gets to her. She's not lazy. She's just waiting for opportunity to work. She would wake up and be there at four in the morning if you told her to. It's just, there's, there's lack of opportunity for her. Mm-hmm . Well, thank you so much for speaking with us today. We really, really appreciate your time.\n",
            "finishSo you graduated this year? Yes. Oh, that's so exciting. What month did you graduate? May. In May of 2021? And so now you're in college. And what is the name of your college? Travecca University. Travecca. And so do you think that Travecca's a good fit for you? I think it was great. You think it's great? Yeah. And what makes it a good fit for you? I got great grades. What made it so easy for you to get good grades? I got a lot of help . Oh, that's awesome. That's awesome to hear. And do you have anything else that you'd like to tell me about Travecca University? No. I don't have anything else, just that I ended up with A's and one B. Four A's and one B. I did. You got a really, really good scholarship too, didn't you? I did. That's awesome - Scholarship and they have to use you, so they took pictures of you to use, huh? Wow. Congratulations. That's amazing. Thanks. Okay. And since the last time we talked to your mom in May, have you worked anywhere or volunteered anywhere? . I just went to college. Just college. Okay, great. So now we can- I've done a little bit of volunteer in college too. Oh, you volunteer in college? Yes. What kind of volunteering do you do? What all did you do for your life calling and purpose class? I've been learning about my strengths and... Yeah, they had the class where they work with them on volunteer opportunities. So they did some... You went to a local high school and helped with gardening, right? Yes. That was during orientation. Yes. And then you've helped pack some boxes of foods, and you helped sticker stuff that went out with the food. So you've done a couple of different volunteer things through that class, right? I did. Oh, that's great. And so did you feel that this volunteering was a good fit? It was. And what made it a good fit? It just helped me a lot. It did. And is volunteering something that you still do? I think so. Is that something you still do at school? Through school, he has set volunteer hours he'll have to do every year. Okay. So he's participating currently? It'll start back up in the spring, yes. Okay. You said it'll start back up after the break? Yes. Yes. Okay. So one moment, and then we'll continue. Okay, great. And now we will talk about some goals.\n",
            "finishAnd so earlier you touched on this, but I just wanted to confirm, you mentioned that he just recently graduated high school? Correct, Sunday. Oh, on Sunday? Congratulations that's so exciting. Yeah. And so that would be May of 2021, and did his high school plans or track change since the last time we spoke? Did that graduation date change since last year? No. Okay. And what type of diploma did he receive? Distinction. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. And so for the rest of the interview I'm going to talk about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he has been involved in. So first I'd like to get an idea of how he normally spends his time. So what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? Typically, he will have, if you're looking at typical  for dinner as a family. And then Sunday, it's the same kind of thing, Aaron's in the morning and then bowling in the afternoon. Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun. Yeah. And you said that he's starting a college program in the fall? Yeah. He's going Trevecca Nazarene. Trevecca, okay. Okay let's see. And can you tell me a little bit about the program? Oh, he's majoring in accounting. So majoring in accounting. And do you know about how many classes he'll take per semester? They usually take, let's say 12, it's like 12 to 15 hours a semester, we have the orientation next month, so I'll know more after next month, but that's working with the school, they have a program specifically for kids with special needs, but books with what we would be a collegiate IEP, if you would. So they will work with him to balance and schedule out. Oh, that's great. You mentioned that it's a disability specific program. Do they offer vocational? He's just going to Trevecca Nazarene as a general student, they just have a student services for kids with disabilities. Oh Okay. So when you can go in and... So just supports? Yeah. And what type of supports do you anticipate he'll be receiving? In talking to them, they said that we're going to play it by ear academically. Academically he did quite well, he graduated with 4.3. Oh my  that's great. So they're not too worried about that, they are going to allow him the ability, if we wanted to take advantage of it, to test outside of the classroom, like independently with a proctor and extended time on assignments if necessary. We are going to just see how he does with that, he had that in his IEP in high school, but didn't use it. But again, a whole different world once he goes to college. Their bigger concern, that his deficits led themselves more towards social interaction. So they're working with some social support for him to work on, they have what would be like a freshman seminar class. And she suggested, there are senior proctors that are in the class, senior grade level proctors, and she thought that it would be helpful if they were aware of his disability to help him integrate into the campus. So they will, instead of having class, some days they would go to the social things that's going on the quad. And she said the older students would be happy to help lead him into conversations with other students or get him out of a situation if it was something where he was feeling uncomfortable. So they're really looking to help him from a social standpoint. That's wonderful that he's going to be getting all of that support, that's great to hear. So honestly that's what made the difference. He got a few offers here in town, that was at one school that said, \"Yeah, I can see he's going to be fine academically but make sure he has a good college experience.\" Mm-hmm . And when will he be starting? He starts in August, August 30th. That's exciting. And you mentioned earlier that there have been no changes in his employment status since the last time we spoke and he's not currently employed. He is not employed now. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you want to share? No, he's just doing well. He went to prom, is that ? I'm going to write that down, that's exciting news. That was big for us.  Well, thank you so much for speaking.\n",
            "finishIs he currently receiving any services through the school system of any kind? No. Okay. And just confirming that he did not exit the school system since the last time we spoke in June. No. And so now I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's attended since June of this year, the last time we spoke, but first I'd like to get an idea of how he usually spends his time. So what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? Currently, because we don't have providers, he does spend a lot of time just at home playing video games. He does have a small business that he works two days a week. Occasionally we're able to get him to the gym or out to eat but most of his preference is to be at home. Mm-hmm. And so how many hours a week does he work at his small business? Probably about eight a week. And does he work with support or does he work independently? Well, I am his support, so I drive him everywhere and interact with his customers and do most of the communicating for him and transportation. And I do have to physically help him on some projects. And so is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school, community college or university since the last time we spoke? No. And so now I'd like to know more about his small business. So you mentioned that he is working for pay with support. What is the name of his business? It's called Unboxed. Unboxed. And can you describe the activity and what he does there? So he has... It's a cardboard recycling route. And so he has residential routes and small business routes where he goes and he removes their cardboard and recycles... Takes it to recycling. And you mentioned the support that he receives, that you support him with transportation and talking to customers and carrying some of the materials. Yeah, he has some small businesses where he breaks down their boxes instead of just collecting them. So he has... some places it's a good, 40 minute workout of breaking down all their boxes and getting them loaded. So he just needs help processing that. And time wise, just to get the job done quicker, I physically help him and then helping him figure out how the cardboard's going to fit in the vehicle to be transported. Does he receive payment? He does. And how did he find this job? My husband and I created it for him. That's wonderful. And you mentioned that he works eight hours a week. What month and year did he start his work there? We started that in March of this year. Oh, that's so exciting. And do you think it's been a good fit for his skills and interests? I think it's a good fit for him, yeah. And what makes it a good fit? I think he feels empowered that it's his business and he has been able to manage the overwhelmed feelings that he gets on jobs he's not too sure about. He's learned how to take a step back and figure things out. People are really supportive of him and want to interact with him. So I think that makes him feel good about himself. That's great. And do you have any additional comments about this activity? No, I don't think so. I mean, honestly the community support was a lot more than what we expected and it could be about a full time job for him but I don't have the ability to help him with it full time. I think it's really a program that we would like to expand for other young adults that are similar to him. I think that would be phenomenal. Yeah. It sounds like it would be wonderful. Yeah, it would be. There's just one of me and I just haven't found the balance between my work and my other children and everything that he needs or wants, to be honest with you. And has he participated in any other employment, volunteering or vocational activity since the last time we spoke? He has done some community volunteering with... I believe it was with the Salvation Army possibly. Great. And does he still currently volunteer with the Salvation Army? No, it was kind of like a one time community thing that they were doing in our local area. And it was just a one day like cleaning up some houses and that sort of thing. And honestly it might not have been the Salvation Army but it was kind of like a community outreach program where young, high schoolers and young adults came together and helped clean up some areas in the community. Oh, that's great. And so now we'll talk a...\n",
            "finishOkay, so I'm back at recording. Sorry for that. So I think for the next part, some of these questions are in a program that I have to access online. So we'll change years and I'll ask you some different set of questions if that's fine with you. And hopefully my connection will be back in the next two or three minutes, but let's talk about Cassandra's high school and her experience in high school. Did she had any jobs during high school? She worked at a bakery. I think she worked at a little cafe bakery. Okay. And do you remember for how long she worked there? Few weeks. Okay. Do you happen to remember the year? She must have been a junior, so 2014. Okay. And for how many hours for those three weeks. Maybe 20 hours a week. And she was getting paid, right? Yeah. Did she get any support while working at the bakery? No. And how did she find that job? It was in her neighborhood and maybe there was a sign in the window. And what was the reason for her stopping working there? It was washing dishes in the back and sweeping and I don't think she enjoyed it. Okay, good. And that was the only job during high school? I think so. What about volunteering in the community during high school? She was involved for four years with ROTC and they were always volunteering and our family was in Boy Scouts during that time. And there was always volunteering And that was all her high school or last... All four years. All four years. Okay. Were there always volunteering events, like preparing food for people or different events or was there something consistent that would happen once a month, even if not for years, but for a period of time? In ROTC, the leaders had some kind of... Well, they did some stuff at the Titan stadium, they did something in a soup kitchen of some sort. So that was kind of serving meals, Boy Scout they did a food drive every year. They do something at a cemetery for advent, where they put the candles out on the graves for the cemetery. They did that every year. She put flags out at a cemetery for Memorial day. The Boy Scouts was pretty consistent, pretty regular. They didn't do the same thing every month, but they did the same stuff every year. Okay, good. And now just getting back to her week, how her week is organized now during this time. She's in the beauty school program? Yes. And that is eight hours a day? Monday through Friday, yeah. Monday through Friday. And that is divided between practicum and some online classes? Yes. Practicum. Is that in person? Yes. So is that at a... Normally, they would go in person five days a week and have their classes at the building than just doing the classes via zoom. Yes. And they go in to do the actual beauty training. Okay. And when did she start this program? It was at May. I forget when she started, but it's about week four or five. Okay. And when is she supposed to graduate? It's a nine month program. Okay. So just... I just asked her the other day, she's thinking end of October. Yes. And other than that, is she currently involving any job, internship or any other activities in her week? No. No. And does she get any supports in this program? Like someone who's typing out the lessons for her or the online classes or no supports whatsoever? No. She had identified that she has a learning difficulty and she has not requested any formal accommodations, but she had disclosed. Okay. So after high school, but before this, she was involved in Vol state. Volunteer State Community College? Yes. And that was for the technician program for animal technician program. Veterinary tech program. Vet tech program. And do you remember the year when that started. The year and month or an approximated? Well, she graduated high school in 2015. So she went to Vol state, August 2015. Okay. And was that a two year program? It would've been a two year program. When did she drop out of that program? I guess you could say October 2019. She never got into the program technically, because you have to do the college basic. Yeah. She was to fill in the college basic stuff. So although that was her plan, she never got out of the college core course. And did she have any accommodations or formal support during that time? She disclosed and filed with the disability office. She told each instructor. The beginning of each semester, but you have to write a paper. So nothing was ever implemented from the disability office. I don't think they could have offered her anything. There was no other... You're either in the class, she didn't need an interpreter or somebody to step by her in the class. Yeah. And if she wanted extra help, she could have gone to the tutoring center, but she didn't have the motivation to do that or the will if all to do that. But they don't say, well, you don't have to write a 10 page paper. You could write a two page paper. No, you have to write a 10 page paper. So in your opinion, what was the reason for Cassandra leaving that program? Or what did she say as far as why she wanted to leave. My opinion is she does not have the intellectual ability to complete the math, algebra stuff. And she became extremely frustrated. In between leaving this program and now the beauty school program. Did she try anything else as far as both secondary vocational programs? Yes. When she left her psychiatric residential treatment program, we went back to vocational rehab and she participated for about four weeks in the Gallatin Vocational Rehab Site. So the focus on that was job readiness and reestablishing your schedule to wake up, get somewhere on time. She quickly met her goals. And well that program did not meet my expectations of what she needed, but she participated in what they offered. And when did that program start? Let's see. She probably started sometime in January and maybe attended for four or five weeks. Okay. What was the reason why you didn't think that was a good program or a good fit for her? I forget what the title of the program was. Yes. In Gallatin, the framework was to have businesses like manufacturing businesses or some kind of hands on business, approach the vocational rehab facility and say, okay, you got somebody who has two hands and can do a task. So train them and test them. And then we are a receiving business that would offer a person with a disability accommodations, but a fairly decent paycheck. They only had one company that was their partner. One company. This company was based Hendersonville. It was a warehouse and what they did is they had gift wrapping for stores across the country. So if you went to a small upscale boutique and you get your purchase with some tissue paper and a nice little bag, that's what they sold. So they trained the vocational rehab participant to count out gift bag and put them in boxes, things like that. We went into the program thinking that A, Cassandra would be a great candidate because we lived very close to the warehouse. She worked at Amazon before, so she knew about warehouse and she quickly learned how to count out bags and put that in, within the first week she would've been ready to go. And they wanted somebody full time for forever. But at the same time, she was learning about the beauty school and applying to the beauty school. And she would've accepted a short term assignment at the warehouse, but she declined the full time forever job because she knew she wanted to go to the beauty school. There were no other alternatives. So for four or five weeks, she dutically went. And this was the winter so the Gallatin place had the same thing, like if school buses don't run, the Gallatin place doesn't open. So my perspective as a taxpayer and a citizen was, this was such a lightweight wimpy little program. They did not offer work hardiness to the average person. When you have to have a job, yeah, you got to drive in the snow. Ha ha ha. You got to drive when it rains. You got to get out there when it's cold. I'm sorry. And to show up at 9:30 to 3:00. Okay. If you're easing back into the world and you have some pain or psychological problems. Yeah, 9:30 to 3:00 is good, but that doesn't work in the real world. Yeah. And also the options were really limited. It's our system. It's not Gallatin. The people that worked there were great. They were so nice. The facility itself was a beautiful building. Had lots of room, had classrooms. Whoever's in charge in Tennessee has not made these connections in the community to say, okay, you've got some kind of production business here that we're going to take three of your graduates and we're going to work with them in give them support and let's see if we can try to make it. So I was disappointed and now the COVID thing they're shut. They're not doing anything. So the five weeks or four to five weeks that she was attending this program, that was not paid. That was just- No, they did. They gave them this stupid stipend of $7 an hour or something like that. No. They had to learn how to . They physically had a card and clock in and then clock out for their lunch and then clock in and then clock out at the end of the day. It was very entry point. Wow. Yeah. Haven't seen one of those in ages. I think maybe once or twice a week, they had little classes like life skills and what the woman did... Oh, I can say this. This was an A plus. Her counselor up there sat down with her and helped her make a beautiful resume. Good. So I will give them an, A plus in that. She came home with a resume that was so impressive. That's good. Yeah. And I think that may be worth it to have and keep that, but I'm sorry she... Yeah, that doesn't seem... So I . It seems really creative, with the drawing and just yeah her hair look amazing. And with so many skills she has that seemed really limiting for her property. The individuals that work in vocational rehab are probably very good and dedicated at what they do. It's the system. I know. Yeah. Sometimes they can't fight with all the procedures they have in place. Yes. That's what we hear. Unfortunately, with book, we have a lot that people have been disappointed and maybe the person assigned to them has been great to work with is just like, there are some barriers that those employees cannot take down. Yeah. And was she involved in any type of educational program or work readiness program in between that and beauty school? No. No. Okay. So that's the last one. And the beauty school, and then as far as employment, so she's not working at the moment, but you mentioned that she work at the Amazon warehouse? She ended her work mid-November simultaneously to her... She had a physical shutdown with being on the night shift and she had a psychological shutdown with failing college. Yeah. That's a lot. Yeah. She just got herself worn down so bad. Yeah. Okay, mid-November. And she had been working there for two years, 25 to 30 hours a week? Mm-hmm . And I can say she was very enthused working for Amazon. She really, as they say, in the United States, strength the Kool-Aid meaning really was with a team attitude of the whole Amazon culture, the people she worked with, it was just the night shift just made her crazy. Yes. I know a lot of people that will go through that, just not seeing the sun or just, they are not prepared for doing something the opposite time that people are awake. Did she have any formal supports for that job while working with Amazon? No. No. Oh, okay. And how did she get this job? Did she apply? She went to a hotel. They were recruiting at a hotel by the airport. And she asked me to go with her and I waited in the car and she went in, she did everything. And what were her tasks while working at Amazon? Was that putting packages together or filling out orders? Yeah, she worked at two different locations and she worked in a guard shack, which when the trucks came in, you had a kind of radio or something to them. So the one place she started out was by the airport. And she liked being in the guard shack and checking in these truck to trailers. Then the other one, they opened up closer to her house and she moved to that one and that, I guess, typical package handling, whatever they do. Yes. Did she had any other job after high school? Yes. She worked in that bakery. I think she worked at a pizza store and then she worked with the dog training place. Okay. So the bakery that was during high school, right? The what? The bakery, that was during high school. Then the pizza store. Do you remember approximately when or...? She must have been in that five year period between high school and now. She worked at a pizza store. She worked at a clothing store. She worked at the dog place and then she worked at Amazon. Okay. And approximately how long was she at each of these? So at the pizza store, clothing store and the dog training place? The dog training place was at least six months. Six months. Okay. At least, if not more. The other ones were more weeks, maybe three months, like a Christmas season. At this clothing store I think she worked during a Christmas season. Pizza store might have been like a summer. But then once she got into Amazon that was pretty solid. And then for the pizza store, what was her job there? What was she doing? I think cleaning the tables, maybe taking an order. I think she worked in the back cleaning dishes. And at the clothing store, what was she doing there? I'm not sure if she did the cash register. She might have done the cash register and then just hanging up the clothes, putting up the clothes. Okay. And then the dog training place, do you happen to remember the name of that bed or...? Five Oaks Retreat. Okay. Perfect. And what were her tasks at that job? They had to feed dogs, wash the dog bowl, take care of the crates, take them out and bring them in. And she was involved with puppies who were giving births. She assisted. That's awesome. And dog training obedience. Oh, that sounds awesome. Cleaning the... There's always dog fur. Yeah. My brother used to... He also wanted to be a vet technician and now he's just not sure anymore, but he used to work at a veterinarian clinic for, I think two years almost. And it was a lot of also cleaning and not the fun stuff, but he really appreciated the time he could spend with puppies and like older dogs. Yeah. It seems like a rewarding type of job. Yeah. Great. So I think as far as... And she didn't have any... She had a lot of work experience really, so that's amazing. But she has so many different... It was a very toxic owner. She would've stayed. She liked the work, but the boss was bad. I'm waiting until you hear some stories on this. It was very strange. Oh, I'm sorry for that. Yeah. We'll probably ask her at some point why she left and if she thought that was a good fit, so maybe. And she didn't have any supports for this job. Okay. Was there any reason why she left the clothing store other than she like... Got it. Left people. Okay. The mall where it is, is in bad financial condition, and just working in a store with the general public people who were stealing things and they were nasty and there's probably dangerous. Okay, great. This is great information. And she did a lot. Wow. So I think we have a couple of questions left from the previous interview. And after that, I think we will be done for today. We did half of, I mean, probably a little bit more than half of what we have to do. And then next time we're going to talk about goals and talk about those goals that you selected for her. And also ask you about services. Like if she's getting any type of services. But do you have 10 to 15 more minutes just to finish the previous one? So my connection came back up. We have three people on the computer right now. We got her backed up on her classes. My husband is working and I'm on with you. We got three people. And you're still... Yes. Mine for the past five days has been ridiculous. Just goes on and comes back for five minutes. So I think that person from the company is supposed to come this afternoon, just to figure out what's going on. Oh, no. Okay. Seems like now it's not working again.\n",
            "finish1039 vocational index. Okay. So for this one, we'll be talking about his employment and volunteering activities that he's been involved in. And then we'll also talk about some general activities that he's that he's done. So he's not currently in high school, correct? He's in transition, but he's graduated high school already. Okay. So is his program a program that is technically still high school, even though he's graduated? Or is it a separate type of transition program? No, it's a separate... It's not mandatory. Oh, okay. It's basically something for him to do. Oh, that's awesome. Because he can go until he's what, 22 I think technically. I'll be honest with you, it's just a time filler. I work during the day and if I didn't have that, he would be up in his bed. Which is what he's been doing school got canceled. But luckily my employer has allowed some caregiver time off. So today I've been able to take the day and get him out. Oh, that's great. So did Chase ever work during high school? No. And did he have any experience volunteering in the community during high school? I remember you said- The YMCA with Jeff, his therapist. I think he might have done that maybe a year, a year and a half he did that. Because we're members of the Y, he was already familiar with the place. He did cleaning the machines, washing the towels, folding the towels, refilling the bottles with the cleaner, stuff like that. He did that in high school. Oh, great. And so for the rest of the interview, I'll talk about some things that he's done after high school. And so what does his typical week look like? And I know that's kind of a tough question to ask given COVID and how things are now, but you said he is involved in a transition program. Did you say \"What does his typical week look like under normal circumstances?\". Are you talking extracurricular as well? Like with the Y's program and stuff? So for the purposes of this assessment, we're not looking quite as much at extracurricular activities, but more volunteer experience, job experience, or training, and educational experience. Okay. Monday through Thursday, he's been going to transition from about 7:30 until 2:30 Monday through Thursday. Friday, he has had his therapist coming and taking him to volunteer at the local food pantry. At the transition program like I said, he was working at Goodwill. He hasn't worked there since last semester. To be honest, he does book club. I don't really even know what that is. They go out in the community, they go to Walmart. I don't send him with money because if he buys stuff that he wants, he doesn't buy what I'm asking him to buy. So I stopped sending him with a list because they take them to practice shopping. He goes shopping with me. He goes there, they ride the trolley. They go to the rec center, I think one day a week. I don't know. To me it's not the best fit for him, but It's better than sitting in his bedroom. You mean his transition program is maybe not the best fit? Yeah. And what is- Besides that. If I may ask, what is his transition program called? Transition To maybe. Transition To. Transition To. Okay. And so how many total hours per week do you think he spends? It sounds like Monday through Thursday, that's 7:30 to 2:30. So that is 28 hours with that. And then Fridays with his worker. How many hours do you think he spends volunteering per week? Volunteering? About three hours. Okay. So I'll say about 31 hours per week in all of these activities. Mm-hmm . Okay. So is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in an academic program at a vocational school or anything like that since graduating? I wish. No. Okay. And so he's currently participating in some activities and I'll put... So the name is Transition To. And you said that they take him shopping and to the rec center. Some of the kids there actually do practice work, practice jobs. But I think since the incident at Goodwill, he may be doing some jobs around the school, like stocking in the cafeteria. I don't even know. Unfortunately, we just had a big meeting. There's a behavioral consultant for the school district and she has put together this big behavior plan that we were going to do. And then school got canceled for the year. So the timing was not... I was feeling really hopeful that they were really going to start... I don't know. His behavior at the transition program has not been the best. It's not been the best. And does he receive supports at that program? It's a contained program. So it's self-contained. It's all people with disabilities basically. So the support is the paraprofessionals that are working with the young adults and the teacher. Okay. And so when he was at Goodwill or doing any sort of job training there, was he paid ever? No. So let's say... Let's see. He's never been paid for anything he's done ever. And regarding the type of activity this is, it sounds like it's not necessarily a vocational training program. Is it more a day program? It's community opportunities like being out in the community, maybe some daily living skills. I think they maybe do some fitness, reading. Yeah. It sounds like a day program to me. That's what it sounds like to me. Yeah. It's just not been the best. And it was really disappointing. The high school program was awesome. He had some really great educators and I feel like he's really regressed a lot since he left the high school program and went into the transition program just because they don't know how to manage the behavior as well. Yeah. His behavior really declined, unfortunately. Yeah. And I've heard of that happening a lot with young adults on the spectrum, as they transitioned out of high school. Really? . Oh, sorry. What was the last thing you said? I said, that's unfortunate because you get your hopes up. You think \"Wow, we're really on a great trajectory here. We're going to get out of high school and we're just going to keep zooming upward\". And then it just doesn't happen that way. And building a new routine and getting used to that can definitely be a hurdle for a lot of young adults and families. So how did Chase find this program? It's... I'm sorry. No problem. It was available after high school through the school district. It's available because he's still under the school district until he's 22. It was just offered. This is what he can do if he doesn't have employment and he's not going to some type of post-secondary program, then he can go here. And do you remember what month and year he started this program? It would've been August 2018. Okay. I'll put... Let's see. Okay, great. And so next I'll ask about his volunteering. And so you said that he has been... Where has he been going again? The pantry? It's called GraceWorks. GraceWorks. Food pantry. It's in Franklin. It's a food pantry/thrift store and they get donations of food and things. So Chase and Jeff have been working in the back where they do the taking things out of the boxes, putting them on the shelves, breaking down boxes. I have a ton of pictures and video if you need any of that, you could see what he's doing. That sounds great. Jeff takes a lot of photos and videos and sends them to me so I can be proud of what Chase is doing. Jeff said Chase does awesome there. And they love him. See, that's just the thing. They all love him there. It's a very supportive work environment. Who doesn't thrive in that? We all thrive in that. And he really rises to the occasion. He's really done well there. Jeff said that he really can stand back and let Chase do his thing. And Chase his very appropriate and is a hard worker. He's not distracted by the usual water cooler conversation that others might be distracted by, he's not distracted by that. And how did he find this job? I just had the idea because I go there, I shop there, I'm a big thrifter. So I said \"I wonder if GraceWorks, if they do accept volunteers\". And so Jeff got a hold of them and just set it up. So yeah, it's been great. It's been really good. That's awesome. It sounds great. Once we're all able to go out and about again, I'd love to check it out. Yeah. It's an awesome thrift store. There's another one in Franklin that actually employs people with disabilities. It's called Our Thrift. I don't know if you've ever been there, but it's a great thrift store as well. Oh, that sounds wonderful. And they employ people with disabilities. That's awesome. It's pretty cool. And my last question about this one is what month and year you think he would've started in this program? At GraceWorks? I want to say September 2019. Oh, wow. So he's been doing that for quite a few months now. Well, just know that as of March, it stopped. Because it's closed to the public. Nothing that he could control. Has he participated in any other sort of employment or vocational or volunteering activities than the ones that you mentioned? Okay. No. And so then next, if you're-\n",
            "finishYou mentioned that he is no longer in school. Did he graduate? Yes, he aged out. He graduated. When did he graduate? It was 2018. 2018. Okay. Has he received any services through the school system since the last time that we spoke last June. No. Okay. So for this section, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's been involved in since June, the last time we spoke. So what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? He's been here at the house. I have a lady that comes in and sits with him. They watch TV. That's why he spends his thing watching TV. Okay. These are just questions that we ask of everyone, even though I know that we've kind of gone over some of these before, so if it's repetitive, I apologize. Is he been enrolled in any sort of academic program since the last time that we spoke? No. What about any job or volunteering opportunities since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. He's been in a day program, but that only lasted a month and due his behavior, he had to leave. I'm sorry to hear about that. Mm-hmm . Okay, so now we'll switch gears again and we'll\n",
            "finishJust confirming he is out of high school. Yes. He's in the transition, the post high school transition program. Okay. He does go to the high school, but he's already graduated. He's in the transition program. Did his high school plans or track or transition program plans change since the last time we spoke? No. When is he planning on exiting the transition program? He can go one more year. One more year. So May of 2022? Yep. Okay. Earlier you mentioned that he's currently working at Kroger. Is he just working one job right now? Yes. Does he receive payment? Mm-hmm  Okay, so I'm going to ask about this job. You said he works at Kroger, and how did he find this job? Through VR. Earlier you mentioned that he works about four hours a week there. Yeah. You said that he started it in December of 2020?  Mm-hmm . Yep. Is this job part of his transition programming? Nope. Can you tell me a little bit about the job? His duties there? Yeah, he bags groceries. Theoretically he greets customers, but because he has autism, that's not something that he's done adequately on the jobs. To be honest, it's a poor fit for him, I think. It's not a good fit as far as like the job, but it's a job. So making the the best of it. Happy to have a job. Does he receive support while working? Yes. What type of support does he receive? A job coach. Job coach. What's the amount of support that he receives, like in terms of being hands on? 100% supervisor. You mentioned that you didn't think that it was the best fit for him, and I just wanted to ask why it's not been the best fit for him. Because it's a social position and he's not a social person. Has he worked and left any jobs besides Kroger? No. Has he volunteered in the community since the last time we spoke? Yeah. Where did he volunteer? GraceWorks. Initially, he was volunteering until COVID and then that stopped. Was he doing that since April of last year or did it stop before then? That's a good question. It was probably before then. You said he had been volunteering before COVID?  Yeah. Where was he volunteering again? Sorry, I couldn't quite hear. GraceWorks in Franklin. Is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you'd like to share? I think that's all for now. Okay, great. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today and this wouldn't be possible without your participation and we really appreciate it. I'm always happy to participate. If you need anything else, just let me know, send me an email. Great.\n",
            "finishAnd so, did he worked all during high school? Yes, he started with Texas Roadhouse, bussing tables the summer before his senior year. Okay. Continued through school. Is that the only job he worked during high school itself? I'm sorry, you cut out for just a minute. Is that the only job he worked during high school itself? Yeah, he had a volunteer job, at the library, but that's the only paying job that he's had. Okay, and that wasn't through school programming? No, that's... completely got the job on his own, and doing well at it. Oh, that's awesome! So, it was Texas Roadhouse, and how did he find the job? I think his school guidance counselor recommended that, she knew some people that work there, and were happy with it, or knew somebody there. So she, actually, gave him the idea to apply there. That's great, and how many hours a week would he work there during high school? While he was in school? Mm-hmm . Well, I think it was what? 15, 15 hours. It's 3-5 hour shifts. Do you remember what month, and year he began working there? August 2018. Oh, wow! So he saw that for quite a while, that's awesome! Yeah, when he goes to school, they just let him start again when he comes back, because he goes to Bowling Green. So when he is come back for Christmas break, or now that he's done with class... well, he's taking a summer class, but it's only one. So he's started back now with them as well. So you said that he busses tables there? Mm-hmm . Can you tell me a little bit more about the job? Like what else he does there? It's pretty much, as far as I know, cleaning tables, and then taking the trash out, are pretty much what he's responsible for there. Okay, and does he receive any support while he works, or did he ever at any point? No. Do you think that this job has been a good fit for his skills, and interest? I think it's worked out pretty well. He's looking into other things for the future. He's getting to the point where he'd like to branch out, and do some different things, but it's just been very convenient that they've allowed him to come right back, and then they know he is only going to be around for just a couple of months. So he's definitely interested in branching out and doing... he's not satisfied with this for a very much longer, but I think it's just been a really good opportunity just to have a job, that's there, that you don't have to find, and you don't have to re-interview, and all of that. So it's working out. That's great, so then after he graduated or since then, what is a typical work week or what... sorry, what is a typical week looked like for him? How has he been spending his time? And this is after high school? Well, recently he was taking classes. Back in March, they said that students can come back to Western Kentucky. So he was doing all of his classes online, and he just finished up, right before the week of Memorial. He had a week before Memorial Day, and then we took a trip. So he's had a lot of downtime lately. But most of the time, during the school year, he's in class, and they've got study periods that he's required to go to, for the Kelly Autism Program, and he doesn't work during school. So that's the majority of his... the next year, that's what the majority of days, is what he'll be doing is school, and study tables, and things like that. Okay, and that's called the Kelly Autism Program? Mm-hmm  It's at Western Kentucky University. Then, when he's not in school, he's generally working at Texas Roadhouse? Right, yeah. Right now, he's taking one online class this summer, that lasts about a month. So he's still going to be working at Texas Roadhouse doing the same thing, bussing tables, while he takes his class. Okay. How many total hours per week do you think he spends working at Texas Roadhouse, and taking the online class? Well, the online class just started today. Oh, that's  So yes, this is going to be a different, we're really... right now they require him to put... to offer three days a week, a five-hour shift. Sometimes they ask him to work over, so he probably won't end up working more than 15 to 20 hours a week at Texas Roadhouse. He's going to have his classes, that I guess, they have like a discussion, there's two different times during the day, 10:30 in the morning, and then one o'clock in the afternoon, that he has to be online. Well, he doesn't have to, but he's going to... he'll take that option, and use that when he needs to. But he'll be studying, and doing all of... they send him a whole packet of things that he's supposed to be doing, and test reviews, and things like that. So, that's going to be from today until July 10, that class will be over. Okay, so how many hours a week, do you think he'll generally be either in class, or in class and working on assignments? I would say, it's probably going to be pretty intense, because it's just one class that goes so fast. Yeah. I would think that he's going to have to put in... I'm thinking, at least five hours a day for class, either logging in, or studying, or doing the homework. And then, like I said, we're not going to force him to work any more than 15 to 20 hours, just to make sure he has the job that is bringing him some, you know, his spending money. Yeah, so I'll put... sounds probably 40 hours total with everything . Yeah, I think that would be reasonable to think that. Yeah, just like a full-time job. Yeah. Well, it's good to stay busy during a time like this. Right. Okay. So The Kelly Autism Program at Western Kentucky, can you tell me a little bit about this program? Yes, I learned about it when he was in high school, and they talked about, that they would kind of be there to be a support for him, while he was in college. And they would look out for different needs that he had. They would make sure that he's aware of resources that are available at Western Kentucky. They provide tutoring, they provide counseling services. So, we just thought it sounded like a great thing, so we applied for it, and he got in and  helps us pay for it. So, it's been really good so far, but we haven't been able to utilize it for even a full school year since he was... They still provided some services while he was at home, but it wasn't like it would've been if he was at school. So- Yeah. But we've been very satisfied with it. I'm glad he has it. It sounds like a great program. Yes, I would recommend it to anybody who had a student with autism, for sure. Is he working towards a degree there? Yes, at Environmental Studies. Oh, cool. So, Environmental Studies, and generally what's the number of classes that he takes per semester? He's taken 14 and 15 hours. He took 14 hours his first semester, and 15 hours his second some semester. Okay, so is that- About four, about- Four classes. At a time He's a full-time student? Yes. When did he start this program? August 2019. So the types of supports he receives... so he receives tutoring, and counseling. What other types? A lot of social events, too, giving them opportunities to interact with other students. That's a big part of it, too, is the social aspect of it. Does he receive any accommodations in classes, like extended test time, or preferential seating? Yes, extended test time, and they will give him a different place to take a test, so that he's not in the regular classroom to take a test. Do you have any additional comments, that you'd like to add about this program? Not really. Just that we feel it's been very useful, and I would recommend it to anybody else that's considering going to Western Kentucky, that falls under the autism spectrum. I think it's a great program. That's wonderful that you found it. Yeah, very fortunate. It's one of the top 20 in the nation, which is surprising in Bowling Green Kentucky, but it is. Was there ever another school, or program, that he attended after high school? Oh, I'm sorry. You cut out for a minute, what type of program? Was there another educational program, since high school, that he attended or was it just this one? Nothing for autism, but he went through the Promise. The Tennessee Promise, offers to educate kids during the summer. If you didn't make a great score, if you struggled on your ACT, they actually go through a program that he went at Ball State, and they just went over some English, math, writing skills, with him. I think it lasted about three weeks. I don't know if counts as something that you're talking about, but it was after high school and before college. Yeah, so it was like a tutoring intensive, for the summer? Yeah, I would say that, it was through the Tennessee Promise. Tutoring during the summer. At Ball State. So when he was getting tutored there, what type of subjects would they help with? It was English, math and writing. And there were several people, there were several other students, that were doing the same thing at the same time. It was like a little class, and they would just change from there, would be an English instructor, math instructor, and then a writing instructor. They would just switch classes, or the instructors would come in and out, or whatever. Okay. Do you remember what month and year he started that? July? I bet... June, okay. June 2019, and it just lasted three weeks. Okay. And so I put, let's see, 2019. Did he receive any supports from that program, while he was there, or were those kind of built-in? Yeah, we just dropped him off, and picked him back up, and just what everybody else, the same thing as everybody else got. Okay, do you happened to know, if there were supports there that were available to people on the Autism spectrum, and he just didn't need them or? I don't know of anyone. It definitely was not advertised for anyone fell under the Autism spectrum. And he did not bring that to my attention, that there was anybody else there with that, or that had been diagnosed. Yeah, so it sounds for him, supports for that program weren't needed? No. Okay, moving on to vocational activities after high school. So we talked a bit about his employment at Texas Roadhouse. Is that the most recent job that he's had? Yes. Okay, so I'll say bussing tables, cleaning tables, taking out trash, and works independently. You already answered some of these. So I'll just go ahead, and fill those in. Okay. He now works 15 to 20 hours a week, and started August 2018. I think you said? That's when he started the job, yes. Okay, and has he worked anywhere else at all, during high school or volunteered or sorry, after high school or volunteered anywhere- After- After high school? No volunteering after high school And no other jobs? It sounds like- No other jobs. Yeah, got a really good arrangement there. Yes, It's working out, like I said, he did trust in some other things.\n",
            "finishOkay, and so you already discussed some of these topics too during the last interview, so we'll just go over those as well. So Nathan is not currently in high school, correct? I think their last official day is Thursday. He's a senior. Oh, okay, so he technically is then. Has he ever worked during high school? Yes. Oh yeah, sorry. You did mention that he'd worked. You said he's worked three jobs? Well, and he was a camp counselor one summer. I think that was technically his very first job. Wow, he's done a lot. Were any of these jobs or internships part of high school programming? No. Okay, and so we're going to answer the following questions about the job that he's held the longest. So, I think earlier you mentioned that that job was Chili's? Mm-hmm . Okay, and that he's a host? Yes. Okay, and how did he find this job? Hmm. He walked in. I think he walked into the restaurant. I'm just confirming. Earlier you said that he worked about 10 to 20 hours a week? Mm-hmm . Okay, and you said that it was 13 months. What month and year do you think he began working there? April, 2019. April, 2019. Okay, and you said that he does currently work there, although hours have been cut due to the current circumstances? Well, he gave his two weeks' notice, so he technically still works there, but only for a few more days. Okay, I'll add a note about that. Okay, and can you tell me a little bit about the job and what he does and his responsibilities there? Sure. He would greet guests, seat met tables, manage the waitlist, wipe down the menus, roll silver, bring drinks, clear tables. Okay, and does he receive any support while working? No. Do you think that this job is a good fit for his skills and interests? No. Okay, and why not? Nathan doesn't really like interacting with strangers. Yeah. His interests seem to be more technical than hospitality. Yeah, and it sounds like he's got some really great other opportunities that you mentioned earlier that are a much better fit. Yeah. So, did he ever volunteer during high school? Yes. Okay, and where did he volunteer? Well, one of his classes was with the Best Buddies program coordinator. So even though technically it was a class, it was mentoring some of the other kids, maybe in the CDC classroom. That was an elective that he chose. We also have a roadside cleanup, so he cleans up the roadside four times a year. Oh, wow. So, Best Buddies. Okay, and I just want to confirm the other jobs that you mentioned. So, I have that you said an intern doing forensic computer work and that he pulls online orders at Walmart, and you said he also was a camp counselor at one point? Mm-hmm . Yeah. Okay. And that he's about to start school. Wow, that's awesome. It sounds like he has a lot of great opportunities. Yes. Okay, so I think that this one is actually done, so that was a fast one.\n",
            "finishSo first about since high school history, if he had any jobs, when he was in high school. And then we talk about what he's doing now, but we... No jobs. He never had a job in high school? No, he did not have a... A job prior to 18. And did he want to? No, no. What he did do was he was part of the Special Needs Sports Foundation here in Hendersonville. And he did some Special Olympics and he did... no he did Borderless Arts. We found that after he graduated high school. So he... I had the homeschool for high school because school was, was so traumatic. They kept expecting him to just get his behaviors under control instead of acknowledging the neuropsychiatrist. And they didn't want to listen that he had autism. I had all these doctors, all these therapists who said, yes, he has. And they said, nope, he doesn't. And what they... their favorite line was, if he has autism, it's not educationally relevant. I am so not lying to you. It was horrific, absolutely horrific. The public school system ruined him. And he has PTSD from so much y'all would not even believe the trauma. Yeah. I mean, when you have to get an attorney twice to make the school system do what's in black and white in rights law, I mean black and white. Yeah. He had no peers in his class. He was the only child in sixth, seventh and eighth and fifth, sixth and seventh grades in that range. And they wanted to keep him in a... in the behavior school because he, I can't even begin to tell you how foolish. So anyway, homeschooled him, I took his IEP and here in Sumner County, he was the most high profiled case for years. And it's because they kept ex... expecting him to control his behaviors, but he has, and they wouldn't accept that he has mild brain damage, even though it's such a complicating factor, but it was obvious. And I mean, the doctors all got it. The school system didn't want to get it, but they were fighting a lot of people. And Sumner county is known for being terrible for special needs kids who are... if they have any kind of behavior issues at all. Anyway, in high school, I had to kind of... drop back and begin all over again and had to reteach socialization. I had to break it back down into nothing and then begin in little steps with a behavioral analyst. Yeah. And she worked with us for a year and a half. And I mean, it was just... nobody has the insurance company tell you, we're going to assign you a behavioral analyst, 25 hours a month for a year and a half. Yeah. If there's not incredible documentation that we had, that his, his case file was ridiculous just through the insurance company. Yeah. It, it really was. So anyway, he's amazing. Only because he came out of the school system not because of... Yeah, what they're doing yeah. That's so some of your questions are, well, thank you. But some of your questions are going to be kind of, my answers are going to be kind of skewed cause of that. Yeah. And I hate that, but yeah.  Personally this is not the first time I hear that from Sumner County. Sumner County is horrific. Yeah, yeah so that's good to know that I mean, now we also kind of understand more about him and what he went through and that's good to know before we get to discussion. Was there any, any postsecondary school program after finishing with... No. So no... No, he doesn't want to do it. I've looked into Let's Come Wear Some Friends. And I said, if you want to do this ideal program, if you want to do the Vanderbilt program, if you want to, I said, I will try and make it happen. I said, but do you want to? Cause one of his very best friends went through the program for three years and yeah, I think went through three years. And he, he thought at first it sounded neat. He, until he realized he had to ride a bus at 7:45, where they'd pick up, they would pick up there and then Hank would ride that. And he wouldn't get picked up again until 4:30 in the afternoon. And Austin's idea of being on his own all day with no one period and that he was expected to go to all of his classes. He was expected to do all of that alone was kind of like Muhammad staring at the mountain. And he just, he just freaked him out really bad. And with the education system, having been what it was, he can't get past the idea that it could be that way again. So. Right. What can you tell me about his typical week for Austin? How does he usually spend his time during the week? Okay, okay. He wakes up at generally it's 8:30 in the morning. He does his morning hygiene, shower, meds. He has, I told you the GP, the gastroparesis. So he has to drink this special protein shake. Yeah. He makes that himself then 9:30. Now this is Monday and Tuesday because Wednesday, Thursday, Friday he has be at work at... that's not true. Wednesday and Thursday. Yes. For now, he's at work at 10:30 because he did, he understood on his own back at the very beginning of working here, it's been the first, first month or so, so he was 18. So about the first month he started working, we I... we would come early. So there'd be that little bit of transition time. Right. So he, in his own mind, he came up with mom, I need an hour of leisure time, that's his terms. He didn't realize that he was needing transition time, but he recognized that he needed about an hour, and he could, he communicated it, which I wanted to shout for joy that was awesome. And then he, they haven't brought my... all these people are going by in... So, oh and once my water just bring me the water. So Monday and Tuesday, so Monday, Tuesday, he wakes up at 8:30. He has to have all his morning hygiene done by 9:30. Then he has chores, which are vacuuming, wiping down the kitchen counters, making his bed. I mean basic stuff. Yes. And then like if there's yard work, so it gets, it gets not as rigid after that first hour in the morning, then he has a little more leeway time. But he has that that's got to be done because if he doesn't have that, he won't do, he'll just put it off forever. He'll just say later, which is the word I hate the most from that child. I'll do it later. Like no cause later never comes. So on Wednesdays and Thursdays, he has to get all of his chores done. Yeah. Including that morning routine done by the time we come to work and then by doing all of those non-preferred he gets to play on his Switch for that one hour before work cause of his electronics issue, it has to be so controlled. Right? Yes. But you make it a really cool fun thing and then he's like all, he's all about getting his Switch for that hour before work, so that's really cool. And it's not a full hour. He doesn't... because sometimes we don't get here until 10:35, then we have to get out of the car, come in, sit down, set up. It ends up only being like 30 minutes, but he doesn't realize that. So, you know... I have a question for the days, what days is he working and how many hours a day? He works, he works four hours on Wednesday, three and a half on Thursday and three on Friday. And it's from 11:30 to 3:33 and 2:30. Does that make sense? So wait three on Friday and then you said Wednesday? It's 11:30 to 3:30, so it's four hours on Wednesday. 11:30 to 3:00, so it's three and a half hours on Thursday and then 11:30 to 2:33 which is three hours on Friday. Okay, perfect. See what I mean? Okay, but on Friday he has his therapist appointment. So he's got to get every, he's got to do as much as he can before therapy. Because we go to therapy at nine, nine to 10. We come here, then he starts working so... Awesome, and is he doing any type of volunteering or any other activities? No...yes. Well Borderless Arts, which is this art program. Okay, yes. He does that and they do zoom meetings. They're doing zoom art workshops, which is cool during this COVID time. Otherwise, they were meeting every Saturday, they were meeting about two to three Saturdays a month. And is that, so what is that? Is that like a workshop or business? . Its Borderless Arts, Tennessee y'all should look that up. It's an amazing, amazing organization. And they teach, they do workshops and they teach different art techniques. They typically last two hours. Okay, awesome. Y'all should look it up. It's really neat. I will I'm, I'm so far into our time, especially at this time, like there's anything they offer online. I'm willing. Oh girl. It's, it's and it's free. Oh that's awesome. Oh it is, it's a not for profit. These guys, we're... because, and it's a pilot program right here in Middle Tennessee, the first of its kind in the United States so that's my understanding. Yeah. I mean it was... represented the teapot diplomats within the Borderless Arts. So the teapot diplomats is the visual arts and that's the pilot program and Austin's done an art exchange with Canada. We... Austin, and two girls, they made the costumes for, for an exhibit at the first, for the Nick Cave exhibit. And then Egypt saw that and Egypt for the for first time in 31... no first time in I saw that one actually the Nick Cave one. Yep. It was awesome, really cool. It, it was, it was so cool. So Austin Tori and Hope, Tori's a girl, Austin, Tori, Hope did the costumes for the down syndrome dancers who, and then Egypt saw the video and they, okay. So they invited because of well because of the teapot diplomats and the who did the costumes and then Borderless Arts in essence, there was a 31 country disability emporium in Egypt. And for the first time ever, they invited the United States because of these costumes. Aw, that's amazing. Wow. And Hope got to go out there she wore one of the costumes. We were the alternate to Hope, Austin was the alternate artist. You know, if Hope couldn't go, then Austin was going to going and had to do with of bit Boston in short. And then a couple, couple of down dancers went and they represented, but guys y'all just don't know. We've done art exchanges with Morocco, Afghanistan, Egypt, Japan, Canada, and it's going and going and going. Wow. This programs is incredible. That's amazing. I'm glad he's involved. I'm going to check it out for sure. I want to see. It turned out that art and I was just desperate to find him something to do. That would be interesting when he was 18 and turns out that with art, he can focus and he can focus for an hour or two hours and not get up and not move. He can't do that with anything. He, he doesn't even do that with, I mean, I guess you sat him in front of a video, a gaming thing, but that's not the same of having focus to create something. This kid's incredibly remarkable, he's really good. So he is, now changing gears to his job, he's working at Culvers, that's the  restaurant? Yes. And you told me when he works there, what is he, is he a server or what is his role there? His, his job is called a runner and it's the people who take the food from the counter, either out to the cars or to the people sitting in the dining area. And it's yeah he takes it very seriously. And they've nicknamed him Jack Flash because he actually runs the food outside. He does love rocket. It's kind of funny. Yeah. I think he's mad at the ones who don't run. It's funny. Yeah it is funny. And he's getting paid for his, for doing his job. Correct? And he's been getting raises all along and he makes 10 or 25 an hour now. Very proud of him. They love him. So how did you find this job? Very funny, the Special Needs Sports Foundation, they were doing a fundraiser here at Culver's. They call it spirit night and they get a percentage of the dining room for the sales that night. And so they needed participants to come serve to take the food to the people. And the owner was here that night and he came over to me and he said, if he ever wants a job, he's got one. You just come tell me. Yeah. I thought Austin might stay for five minutes. You know, strangers at every table, not knowing what he... you know what I'm saying? And I mean that child took to it like a duck to water. So it took a year Austin was 16 and a half at the time. And it took a year and a half before he turned 18 because I was told, do not whatever you do get him a paying job before he turns 18. So as soon as he turned 18 and we ate here after that point and the owner just thought Austin was the best thing since sliced bread. And he would talk to him all the time and say, and he'd say, dude, when you get, when you turn 18, you come here and he did and we did. And that's that's been it, so they recruited him. That's awesome... It is isn't it? Because that can be so stressful, that knowing he can't... Oh... And found something he enjoys doing and that he's enjoying. It's... we couldn't have been more fortunate. It, it was just such a blessing. Yeah. When did... do you remember the month and year when he started the job, approximately. This is 2020, right? Yes. So it would've been April. I think it was April of 26... 2014, no, 16. He's been here four years and he just celebrated. I'm pretty sure it's April is the... it's either April or May, but I think it's April, so that would've been 2016. Yes and is he getting any support from this job or not? They, they were supposed to come today. His support coordinator with Amerigroup because of in the ECF choices program, she thought he could, he might benefit from a job coach or job support. I don't remember now, but if it's called job coaching, I don't remember the term she used, something made me think of that. And she, they were supposed to come today and I didn't get their email that they were coming today until after the time they would've been here. So I just dropped him off. So I have no idea if they showed up them off, I emailed them back and said, weirdly, I just got this email. How did it go and I haven't gotten any emails. I don't know if he met them. I don't know. I don't know. Cause Austin tries to do, he's doing all... He's doing time on his own since COVID he started back and that's brand new and that's what we're hoping for. Joey is his coach that's new, have him for the last four years. He didn't have one that's after... No he's had me. Yeah, okay. And I've had to sit here through all of his shifts for four years. Wow. And he... Why is that Laura? Is in that case something happens or he... His anxiety he, no, it's his anxiety. He would, and you never know when it's going to get, I mean, he'll go shifts and he's fine. And then he'll and I started going, sweetheart, can I at least go look at some shoes in the strip mall, that's like right here? And he's like, well, how long will you be gone, 30 minutes? Well, as long as you're back that kind of thing. So we would periodically try to like, let me go somewhere and come back and give him an exact time. That kind of thing. I mean his anxiety that can start. I mean there it's so pitiful. Well like, one time I tried to go for an hour and he ended up in the employee bathroom huddled under the sink, just rocking and had his hands over his head, just rocking. And they called me on the phone and said, we can't get in the bathroom, he's locked it. We don't know if he's okay. We don't know and we don't know if he's like taking his clothes off feeling bound or whatever. So they didn't want to just walk in on him. And I said, I'm on my way I came back. So the manager, I unlocked the door and then I went in and I, he was just, his eyes were dilated. He just was gone. Yeah. He was gone. And I had to do what I do to I talk to him, I bring his face to mine. I say, I'm right here and I put my eyes right in front of his eyes. And then we had a service phone for her name was Jackson and he got her when he was ten. And she absolutely gave us a lifeline. I mean, we lived three years in our house with dead bolts all turned the opposite ways so that he couldn't because he was a genius at strategy and figuring out how to unscrew bolts, but he was a runner and he always thought he could... He was so impulsive and he would do things and not think about them. He'd just do, just bolt, and he'd think he could run faster than cars. He'd cut through rush hour traffic. He would guys several times he almost died. And it just, it was just very traumatic. But anyway, we got taxi and she would do this physical disruption. Right? So she would call it hugs and kisses. Hugs were the grounding pressure and the kisses would, when he'd get into what I would call a mental tornado, which they can't come out of and human voice was aggravating and human touches, aggravating. So something about the dog she'd get up in his face and lick him. And it would redirect him physically without words without, I mean, we're talking meltdowns that was within two hours to 10 minutes. It just... Wow. Yeah. Well, she was hurt in an accident where a woman hit us and she had permanent nerve damage down both her back legs. So Austin regressed her, the only place he would come was work. He quit doing everything. He quit going, he quit doing everything and he was afraid she was going to die every day at every minute. And she lived on his bed and for an entire year we did nothing except come to work. And as soon as we're finished work, we went straight back. And if so... I'm sorry, hold on. Thank you so in losing Jackson, we lost the momentum of him letting me leave for a little bit. And then he was terrified that I'm going to die because of that wreck and already with a severe anxiety problem that just snowballed back. And, and so then I wasn't allowed to go anywhere at any time I had to be right here in the store. And so this whole COVID thing has allowed him to come back, but see, they only had the drive-through open, so I couldn't sit in inside. So it just automatically I had to go home. He didn't think about it. We didn't have to address it. I just had to go home and come back. And that's his favorite thing to do because at the cars, they just, he gives reads the order, gives it to them. And if they want ketchup, he goes back and gets ketchup. Something not often is the order wrong. He has to come back in and relay that. But so now that we're... it's in the sport, he doesn't expect me to stay. Yeah. Because I wasn't during drive through so this has actually weirdly been kind of a really cool new environment and he's not stressing out that I'm not there. I mean, I didn't come here until two, well until like 10 till two to sign on for you guys, I stayed away from 10:30 until 2 and he's done just fine. One more question related to the Culver's and does that work fro you well? Like he, he doesn't have a support yet, at least not official support, but now there's a coach who he will be going at some point with. But does he have any formal supports like employees like things that are helping him out, like visual schedule? His employer or, or his supervisor or even the other employees had to put him or help him out in the beginning or, or later.... He has, he has a couple of, he's had a couple of managers who would of keep an eye out for him who... the majority of them feel very protective. So, and then there are... Mac is protective of him, but Mac has an autistic child. So, and Mac is now the general manager. He went from, he's worked his way up, assistant manager, so now he's general manager. So he's here during the day shifts, Austin didn't used to work day shifts. He would work afternoon and evening and then like one manage. So him being here to during the day has really checked off some really neat things in moving him toward a more successful... for him situation here. So Diane is a lady that makes sure that he drinks water, she's a coworker. Mac is very protective of Austin. Katie, the other manager is very protective. Then you have coworkers who just know him, they've worked with them for years. They just get it. Nice. You know? So that's, so he's done. He, I really could not even begin to imagine. There'd be another place that has been so... providentially made for him. That's so great, that he found them and they found him cause... Amen. Very helpful. Amen. Yeah. So that's, that's the last question for this one.\n",
            "finishDo you want me to stay or is this just him? Whatever he's most comfortable with. How about you let me walk over there, get my glass of water and come back. No. No. How about you get the feel of how this is going to go and then I'll step way for a moment just to get water. No. We'll revisit this in a minute. Okay, ladies, I will stay for the moment. Okay. Okay. So first I just want to talk to you really fast about the job that you work at. It seems like you really enjoy it, but I wanted to see what you think. So do you think that it's a good fit for you? Yes. Okay. Sorry, what did you say? I work really hard. Yeah. It seems like you do. I mean, I saw it. I'm tired, my feet hurts. Your feet hurt, I bet they do. And then what else do you like about there? The people there, most of them. A lot of them are very nice and they spoil themselves, so it's good. Yeah, that's awesome. And do you have anything else that you want to tell me about your work? What you think about it. And if not, that's completely fine. Nothing that . Okay. Well, that one was very short.\n",
            "finish... still in high school. Mm-hmm . And we went over this earlier, but just confirming that he is not currently working? He is not currently working. And this is just something that we ask of all parents. Why is he not currently working? Let's see. The group of challenges he has together make up the profile of someone who... he would have an extreme amount of difficulty making even the smallest personal decisions at a work place. He would be confused about why he was there. He has extreme difficulty paying attention for longer than maybe 20 minutes. He has been known to have problems with aggression if he's confused or is in an unknown your atmosphere where he's not sure what's expected and he's nervous. He's got severe OCD, and so that adds a whole element. He's mostly nonverbal, so he wouldn't be able to have a conversation with any kind of supervisor or colleague, he wouldn't know what to do during a lunch break. But those are the basics. Mm-hmm . I imagine he has not worked in  jobs since we last spoke with you. But what about volunteering in the community since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And so now we'll move on to talking about some goals that we-\n",
            "finishFive. And do you need a break, do you need to get water? I'm okay. But I just need to respond to this message. I'm not ever ignoring you at all. I just couldn't get off work and had- Oh, no worries. No problem at all. Yeah. Let us know when, when you are done with the message and we can, we'll take a second for that. Okay. Okay. And Caleb is in high school, he's graduating in two years, correct? Yes. So, and you said Caleb never worked during high school, but he did those, pet sitting for his neighbors. Right. And then he volunteers about three days a week at the animal shelter. Okay. So, And, but what animal shelter is it? It's the Williamson County, No Kill Shelter. Okay. And that's three days a week. How many hours a day? About an hour and a half. He would probably stay longer, but they don't let them stay any longer so, And how long has he been doing that? Just the fall. So, I think it was probably August or September when he started going there. And what type of activities does he help with in the shelter? I mean, he feeds and waters the dogs, he changes, and the cats, he cleans up the yard, be it toys or trash or poop or, whatever. He cleans stall, cleans out their stalls that they're in. I don't know what else he does. Sorry. No, that's fine.  all the animals. Yeah. Yeah. Does he get any type of supports while volunteering there? So we are so lucky because the lady that runs it was a kindergarten teacher, so she just is used to really working with students to begin with. And then she has really been wonderful, because she's implemented giving him a clipboard and these are the things he's responsible for in that order to accomplish that day while he's there. So she's really trying to work on helping him be independent while he is there. And being able to come there by himself, by the time he is 18, because they won't let you be there by yourself until you're 18. So she's really helping him. But, so I mean, yes, I think that we've been very honest with her about who he is and where he is. And so I think that she does offer him extra reinforcement and things like that, but it's not like he's at, McDonald's getting extra support. Do you know what I mean? So Yeah, but she's, I mean she's put in place as a form of support to make this run more smoothly for him. Mm-hmm  . Great. And you, sorry is Caleb not, isn't he 19 or how old is Caleb? 17. Oh, he said, okay, so I'm going to change. I think we have his date of birth as December 4th, 2000. Is that- No, he's 2002. His brother is-. Oh, i'm sorry. Okay. I'll change that. No worries. He's 2002. Yeah. Okay. Great. Because I was looking at, he's and I was like, oh then, great. So he is 17. That makes sense. He's 17. He'll be 18 in December. Sorry. No, no worries. Other children was born in 2000, so I'll make a note of that and we'll change that, that's good to know. And then as far as any work during high school, he did that pet sitting and that's something he only did with that one neighbor, family? He had some other neighbors that he's pet sit for as well, but we have to drive him to those. So he doesn't really do that as much by himself because he can't get there by himself. But he can go to this one, he remembers and he gets up and he goes, he really does that. He gets paid for that? Mm-hmm . Right. And is Caleb in any type of special education classes or is he getting a regular- No, he's mainstreamed, he's in inclusion classes, but he does have an aid. Yes. Not an individual aid. If he had an individual aid we'd be in much better shape, but he does have the group aid in class. As long as it's a core academic class, but not in any of his electives or non-core academic classes. Okay. Awesome. So those are all my questions.\n",
            "finish... In the garage, she can do artwork. She can dance. They have like a little bar and dance floor for her. And like a ballet bar, I should say, not a drinking bar. And then she walks a little bit. She listens to music. She does artwork. She talks to her friends online and teaching her to take care of her bed, vacuum her room, fold her laundry. I would say that's what a normal week looks like. Sounds like she's definitely staying... The lunches and the dinners. Yeah. Which is great. She finds ways to keep busy. And so now, I just wanted to talk a bit about her school program that she graduated from. So what was the name of that program again? Well, she graduated with a social work bachelor's degree from Austin Peay, and she did participate in the full spectrum learning program. And graduated with in social work. And so were her classes, was she entirely with people, other people who were on the autism spectrum or were there some class that were with other types of students? Right. Her entire college career was exactly like anybody else's college career, except she had tutoring resources and accountability. A weekly accountability thing with the full spectrum learning program. Oh, great. That's an awesome support. And.. She would have graduated with honors, had they not enrolled her in a statistics math class her very first semester of school. Oh, statistics. That... At that point, I was like, I want my daughter to be independent and I'm going to let the university look out for her because it is the special program that deals with people with autism. And they do see her math score on the ACT and if they didn't put her in statistics, but it had some other name. So it wasn't until halfway through the semester, I realized they had the statistics. So she took it twice and failed it. And finally, when she changed her major to social worker, that she didn't have to have it anymore. That's if it weren't for that one class, she would've graduated like mostly all A's and B's. Oh, well, that's still really impressive. And statistics is very hard. So I very much ... I took that. I took a class in college, also a school in North Carolina, and that was my worst one. So I feel her on that one. Yeah, totally. And yeah, so. And what was the average number of classes that she was taking per semester? We tried to keep it at 12. And so I'm assuming that's full time and... Yes. I know you said she graduated in August. Do you remember the month and year that she started? Yes. It took her five years to graduate. She started in August of '15. And so it took her five years. She took one or two summer school classes. We always try to keep 12 hours. We tried to keep three classes that were sort of real and one class that would sort of not be so challenging. And I was just always told her, \"You're going to graduate from college and it doesn't matter how long it takes.\" Cool. Yeah, and that's wonderful. It sounds like it was a really good fit for her until things shut down. And so you mentioned the support she got. She got tutoring, so let's see. The full spectrum program, so tutoring and accountability. Were there any other supports that she received, or any accommodations like extended test time or things like that? No, she did not want any accommodations. It did teach her over the course of five years to advocate for herself though, because she had to go to disability services a few times. Problems with teachers, I think one teacher even got fired. Wow. For the way he talked to her in class. Yeah, and... I'm so glad she stood up for herself. That's awesome. Yeah. So I thought the university handled it really well. But yeah, she did good. Probably, if anything ever happened at all, which I don't know if it ever really did, she would turn in her papers and everything typed because her handwriting is really, really awful. She can't even hardly read her own handwriting. I also relate to that. And do you feel, so it sounds like it, but I'm just going to ask anyway. Do you feel that this program was a good fit for her? The full spectrum? Mm-hmm , or Austin P in general? Or what in general? Austin P in general? Yes. Yes, I think it was. The only thing I would suggest, and it's a brand new program. She was the first class to start it. It should have been more hands on, like they should have noticed earlier on that she was failing in class. And so, whoa, you're failing in class. Let's start helping right now with adequate help. And because you want to treat students like they are independent adult students, but they do need a little more over being in guidance. And as the mom, the professor wasn't going to email me when she started failing. So I would suggest that would be helpful. And... And eventually, if it could blossom into a program where the students could live in the dorm on campus, that would be spectacular. My daughter is, my other daughter is a social work major at Appalachian State College in North Carolina. And they have a program that's called diverse scholars, educational something, I don't know. But it's just for students who could not get a traditional college degree. And I think it's pretty expensive actually, but you send your son or daughter to Appalachian, where they get to live on campus and go to classes and be a college student for two years. And they don't get a degree or anything. But the program that my daughter works with supports those students. They're there for them 24 seven. They'll take them out to dinner, to the grocery store, go on a hike with them, whatever. And it's just really neat. If Austin P could blossom into something like that with independent living, because I think when you live independently, if you are capable to live independently with some support. You can learn a lot of things a whole lot easier and faster than if you're at home and your mom and dad do everything for you. And it's just easier that way. So in that program, they live independently with support from the social work students at Appalachian? Well, not from all the social work students, just the... Well, you don't even have to be a social work student. You have to be a learning, I forget, a learning scholar mentor or something. I forget what it's called. The program is F, I can't remember what it's, but it's something like diverse scholars or scholars diversity or something that Appalachian State College and doing North Carolina, if you wanted to Google it. And my daughter is a fellow there, and so that's her job. That's good. On top of her classes, to be there for those students. Yeah, that sounds wonderful. And so lastly, we can discuss a bit about her internship. And so this one was, let's see, was this... I'm assuming it was not for pay since it was through school and for like clinical hours. Correct. No pay. And it was for college credit? Yes. And do you happen to remember the name of this company or agency? No. I know it was like a Clarksville-Montgomery county service for families. I don't remember the name of it. So I'll just say like a family service agency. Like they have social services agency. Yeah. Definitely not private, definitely public. Government or whatever. And can you describe what she did there, both before and after COVID began? Yes. Before, she had to show up on time, dressed appropriately. She did it four days a week and a couple of those days were kind of four to five hours. One day though, was like eight or nine hours. Oh, wow. And that was very hard for her. And just the act of showing up and being on somebody else's time and being accountable and having to do what they want you to do the whole time. And you can't just go for a walk or go swing or go eat a snack or go to the bathroom, or whenever you want to. That was very good for her, I think. It was challenging. And I think she could have benefited a lot from that, but obviously it got cut short. But while she was there, she would learn procedure and interact with the children and clients a little bit and sit in on sessions, as just a listener and observer. But she did get to, she did have a few opportunities where she was able to participate in the sessions too, with the families. So once that switched to virtual after COVID, there wasn't so much accountability. It was all, here's these 500 million emails with these 500 million things that you could watch a video or take a class or listen to a lecture. And it's up to you to pick out what ones you're going to do and keep track of your hours and turn it in and get it done. So some people in her program, they knocked it out fast. They did that stuff 24 seven, and they filled up their sheets and they were done. And she was just struggling, struggling, struggling. And that really bothered her when she would see the people from her group submitting 100 hours or whatever, and she's at 30 or whatever. But she finally, she did it. She got through it. I wish the real internship people worked out, but I'm glad, so glad that we were able to do it virtually because I really think if she would've had to put all this on hold for six months or a year. It would've been really hard, just gotten back into that frame of mind to complete it. So in the virtual, she would have to watch the lecture, listen to the recording, read whatever. She didn't really like the reading ones. And she would have to document it and write a few things about what it was about. And she would weekly turn that into her advisor, get that signed off on. And... That was pretty much it, I think. Did she receive any supports while participating in the in-person internship? Well, not legally, no. I just always assume that people are compassionate and helpful when they can be, like if she needed extra time in the bathroom, they didn't stress her out about it. I know that they would let her have snacks sometimes during parts of the day that weren't really lunchtime. But I think they did make some unofficial, not legally mandated allowances for her. But I appreciate that. And it sounds like she was working there about 30 hours a week? Probably. Yeah. Yeah, it was like 20 to 30. I am terrible with anything with a number in it, so. Oh, it's... Everything screwed up, but yeah. And do you remember... It was a lot. Do you remember the month and year that she started the internship? January 2020. So was it like January to March then, that she was in person there? Roughly. Her paperwork was jacked up. And I really think if I wouldn't have stepped in, her paperwork would still be jacked up. She had tons of background information and background checks and this and that and the other. I tried to let her do it all independently. And it was at such a point where the big machine really didn't care if her paperwork was hitting a snag and lost. They would've never fixed it. And so I had to be very proactive to get all of her paperwork squared away so she could start. So she actually started her internship a couple weeks later in January than everybody else, because of all of those issues. And did you feel that when it was in person, that this was a good fit for her skills and interests? Yes. And what made it a good fit? I felt like it was definitely. Yeah. Well, I felt like it was challenging, what she needed, but a supportive small environment that was working with families and children. She loves children. She really empathizes with children, feels comfortable around children and she's very smart. So she's also been through a lot. She's very articulate. I felt like helping other families, helping children, a day of not behind a desk all day, but being behind a desk and maybe meeting with a family or playing with a kid or doing an errand. I thought that was a good mix of activity for her. But at the same time, it wasn't like Disneyland either. It definitely had potential to learn a lot and to challenge her a little bit. So I think that would be good fit. And do you have any additional comments about this job or program or about this internship? No. I'm very thankful for it, so I hope it can help her get some opportunity in the future. And it sounds like she has not been involved in other employment or vocational activities since then because of COVID and... Correct. So it looks like... Oh, maybe because of COVID and because of lack of motivation. And is there anything else that you would like to update us on or share with us today? No. I just think we're trying to look at coronavirus as something... We're trying to find the positives in it. And I think this time at home for her, without everything going on around her, she's doing a lot of learning about herself and growing. And for whatever reason, lately she's been able to manage her emotions a lot better, and which I know makes her happier, more fun to be around, so forth. But yeah, it's very hard for somebody who is a person, who is a very social person who likes to be engaged with other people all the time and go places all the time. It's definitely been challenging for her a lot.\n",
            "finishOkay. This is Participant 2019 and it's January 27th, 2020. All right. Great. Here we go. All right. Not in high school anymore. You mentioned while we were on our way downstairs that  has worked during high school, correct? Yes. Did he do any volunteering during high school? He did. Okay. Well actually, before we get to volunteering, can you give me a roundabout idea about how many jobs he had while he was in high school? Probably three. Okay. And was there one where he worked longer than others or one that was his central job? The one he took a little bit after he got out of there was, he was an attendant at FFC. What's that stand for? It's a health club here in Oak park. I don't know FCC stands for. It's right around here. Oh, it must be the one that people park in that lot to go to, right? Okay. Because sometimes I see people in gym . Did he receive payment at that job? Actually, no. That was more of a volunteer work to develop his work skills. And did he receive payment for any of the jobs in high school? Yes. He was working at Culver's while he was in his last year of high school, which he is still at right now. Oh, okay. And how did he find that job? It was while he was preparing his job skills at FFC. His job coach found an opportunity because some of the other kids he knew, worked there and there was an opening for . So he was able to get him in there. Okay. That's really great. Did he stay at FFC or switch over to Culver's? He left FFC last year around March and then he's still . He also works at a place called Happy Apple Pie Shop, which I don't know if you guys ever heard of it. They're in Oak Park and they're in Harrison and the woman who opened the shop has a daughter who has special needs. And she opened it specifically so people with special needs, she can employ them. And she loves making pies too. He's there on Friday. She wants to hire him as an employee. We're working on that right now and they have some of the best pies. Happy Apple Pie? Happy Apple Pie Shop. Okay. I'm going to ask you more about that in a minute... I'm going to write it in here. When we get to talking about now. Okay. Where is that? I'd love to go. It's on Harrison Street. It's on Harrison. Okay. It's right by the Art District. Not too far from the Art District. So it's really great price. I think they're closed on Mondays, but I believe they're open the rest of the week, so. Well that's good because . Happy Apple Pie Shop. That's really great. Okay. Just very briefly looking at high school. About how many hours a week did he work during high school at Culver's? We'll focus on Culver's because it was the last one. Probably he was there twice a week. At the time when he was in school, maybe two to three hours a day. Okay. So about six at the most. And do you remember when he began working at Culver's? Like the month? It was right before he left school. So it was still in March. And that'd be 2019, right? 2018. In 2018. Glad I asked. And you said yes, he does currently work there. It's asking me and I'm just curious how you want me to put this if it was part of school programming. Now, you said the job coach from the school found it for him but was it separate from the transition program Well, it was supposed to be a part of his transition program when he leaves school. He was still in school and he found he was still working, but after he left, that was going to be his transition job away from high school And he's still there? He's still there. That's great. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about what he does at Culver's. He does guest services, which means he makes sure the tables are clean, everything's stocked. He also takes food out to the lobby area to guests and outside if it's permitable. Okay. Restocks. Does he restock? If napkin to be there, straws, making sure everything's neat and clean. Great. Thanks. Excellent. And then while he was in this job or now as well, does he receive support? Job services? Well, here's the thing he did when he first started. And then they felt as if which I didn't agree that he was good, he could be left alone. And he has had a couple incidents which happened this last week where the job is saying that he needs to have a job coach with him or they not really sure about what's going to happen with his employment. Okay. So he needs support now. Yeah. How long has it been since he's had job support there? I believe it was March of 2019. Okay. So almost a year. Do you feel like this is a good fit for , this job? I think it is. I just want to make sure that... because the whole purpose of supportive employment eventually is to phase out that job coach. And I just want to make sure that they understand that they have to provide natural supports within Culver's. Even if it's one person, he works Thursdays, even it's one person who they can pair him up with, just to make sure everything's going well, make sure that when he's actually working with guest, he's saying \"Thank you\" and \"Please.\" Okay. He loves working there, he looks forward to Thursdays and he calls his own transportation. He gets ready for the day. That's great. Okay. And we'll get back to Culver's since he's still working there now after high school, I'll probably have some more questions about it, but I'm going to jump to volunteering in high school. So you said he did volunteer during high school. Can you tell me where? He was at the Brookfield Zoo. I think it was at the Hamilton Place Center. And he would greet the guest and prepare the covering books and the crayons for the kids that would come in. And he was there for a long time. Most of his high school career, he was there. Really? Okay. Wow. How often was he there? I think he went on Wednesdays for about five hours. Great. Okay. So now we're going to just look at his academic programs, employment, and volunteering after high school. So can you give me an idea of what does a typical week for  look like and how does he spend his time? Okay. Let's see. He works on Thursdays. And then on Fridays, he goes over to Happy Apple Pie Shop where he works for about five hours. Sunday through Wednesday, Sunday, we normally go to church visit my mother, his grandmother. Mondays, he usually will help with chores around the house. We have a dog, so he feeds the dog and we do laundry. So he gets his laundry already prepared for the week. He helps his uncle who lives with us, prepared recycles  things like that. So usually whatever we need him do from that Monday through Wednesday around the house, he helps to do. Okay. Great. That's really helpful. Okay. Is he in any academic programs? Post-secondary? Anything like that ? Not right now. Okay. All right. Is he doing any vocational programs? Anything like that? No. Okay. Great. How many total hours do you think during the week does he work at the two jobs combined? 10. Five at each is what you said. Okay. Happy Apple Pie Shop. That's really nice. My fingers need to warm up a little today. I'm not as fast as I usually am. Thanks for being patient with my typing. Okay. Culver's, you told me a little bit about what he does. We've already talked about that. And he's paid at Culver's? Yes. Okay. You told me about that. Some of this you've already told me, so I'm just going to go fill it in for you instead of asking, Okay. Happy Apple Pie. Let's talk about that. Has he had any other jobs since high school besides those two? That's it. That are paying for employment pay for him. That's . Okay. Well, we can talk about volunteering in a minute. Okay. So can you tell me a little bit about what he does at the pie shop? Well, a lot of their, of course, it's apple pies. So a lot of their pies have apples in it. So he's responsible for cutting up the apples. He's responsible for cutting the butter and all the food prep to make the pies. He prepares the boxes that the pies go in and he just does a lot of the prep work, which he loves to do. And they love it when he comes, because they say he works on the time he there, the time he leaves. He's always keeping busy. He's a hard worker. Yes. Great. And you said, is he paid for this activity for this job? He is not yet, but she does want to hire him. Okay. Great. And did you mention, how did he find this particular job? Same thing. The mother has a daughter. They were in the site program together.  Who owns a shop. And when she was preparing, before she opened it, she came to a parent meeting and told us what she's trying to do. And she wants the kids to come through and help to volunteer and eventually, hopefully hire them. Okay. Great. And then what month and year did he start this job? Happy Apple Pie Shop. He was there before he left school and he just continued. So I want to say Probably March of 2018. Okay. Great. And do you have any other comments about this job that you want to add? He loves this one too. And I think this one, it seems more it's catered toward him and for him because everyone knows him. So I think he has a lot of natural supports there versus at Culver's. And the person who owns a shop, she has a child with a disability. So she gets him and he brings fun and a liveliness to the environment because when he gets there, he makes us into Motown. Fun. So they're singing and dancing and cutting pies and making pies. So I actually like this employment model for him a lot better. I'm not saying that Culver's isn't great, but this one I think really fits who he is and allows him to be his best at what he does. And it seems like to me, he's really focusing knows what he needs to do when he's there. Okay. A lot of natural supports too, which is key. Yes. Okay. Great. And Jan will be asking  Has he participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since leaving high school? No, that's it. Great. Okay.\n",
            "finishVocational experience next. So I'm going to ask you some questions about what he's doing now and what he's done in the past. And I believe I heard you guys say that he is still in high school, right? Because he hasn't transitioned out yet. He's 21, right? He's about seven months. Okay. All right. So if you don't mind, just give me one second, get this set up. All right. Still in high school. All right. So has he worked while he's been in high school? He's had vocational sites that he's gone to. Okay. But not paid work. Not paid. Okay. And about how many, over the course of high school? Do you remember? Four or five? Mm, not. Well, he went to the library. The volunteer or truly voc jobs? Just the voc jobs cause we'll talk about volunteering in a second. Okay. So, if we could just- So, he's been to the library, he's been to DoubleTree and that's pretty much it. Fruit pantry  That's volunteer. That's not voc. So, two? That's why I was asking, yeah. Okay, great. And you said no payment? No payment. And where did he either... Was there one where he worked the longest or, which was the last one? It was about the same, the most recent one was at DoubleTree. Okay. DoubleTree Hotel. And how did he get this job? Was it through the school? Mm-hmm. It's one of their book sites. Great. And about how many hours a week does he work there? Two, twice a week. Two hours for twice a week. And when did he start working there? Do you remember? So he is not there anymore. He was there for about a year. So, that was last year. Do you consider his current high school a voc? Well, they would. They would consider it a voc job. So then it's three. So that, okay. So right now he's in the school building, working with the job coach, setting up the culinary lab and doing laundry. Okay, so school culinary lab. Great. And he's been doing that since this  Since the fall. So like August, you start in August, I'm guessing, right? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. So about four months. Actually wasn't even... Yeah, I guess it was. And still four hours a week about the same amount? Yes. Okay, great. And he's still working there now, right? Yes. Okay. In the school. Great. And part of job school programming, I'm guessing as well, right? Okay. So now I'm ready. Can you tell me a little bit about this job? What does he do? So the one in school? Yeah. The one he's doing right now, we'll focus on that. So the school has a culinary that the students use. So his job is to go in there and make sure everything is set up in terms of all the kitchen stations have the right supplies. The knives are in the right place, forks and knives. Organize and restock basically. And then checking for expiration dates. He also does laundry So the kitchen towels and uniforms. So he's learned how to use a laundry machine, the washing machine, the dryer. Okay. Trying to think what else he does. He was supposed to be in the grocery lab, but I don't know how often he actually gets in there where they're supposed to teach him how to bag groceries. Okay. . But I really don't think he's gotten, he's been in there once that I can remember. A few times. Hopefully next week he'll start something new. Okay. Yeah. So in the- Often do they change it? ... Well, it's based on, they wanted to see improvement over the course of what they called one month of work shifts. So he had to do 10 sessions. Okay. Okay. At twice a week, so five weeks. Okay. Yeah. If he could do that, then they would move him to something else. And I think he had trouble. So the clock started over again. So I think this is the second round. So hopefully he can make it through this week and then he'll be on to- So he's supposed to take carry out orders for staff where staff can order food from different fast food places, and then he would go pick them up or he'd take the orders, phone them in and then pick them up and deliver them to the staff. And pick them up at the restaurants or when they come to the front door of the school? I think at the restaurants, I think that's still trying to be, they're trying to work that out. Okay. But we live, we live, the school is literally right across the street from the mall. Right. So he could walk across the street, pick up, if it's two or three orders and then bring them back. Got it. Got it. Okay, okay. And while he's working on these jobs, does he receive support? Yes. Yes. Can you kind of tell me a little bit about what that looks like? There is a job coach who works with him one on one and is supposed to preview is supposed to... Actually, at this point, she's supposed to challenge him a little bit to see if he can work independently and throw in some of those, okay, well I guess for lack of a better word curve balls to help him try to be a little more flexible and to deal with things when they're not expected. Great. And she is with him the whole time or? Yes. Okay. Is it just Steven or are there other kids with disabilities working? Just Steven Okay, great. Do you think that this job, the one he's doing right now is a good fit for him, for his skills and interests? Definitely has the skills to do it. I don't think it's challenging enough for him. I don't think there's enough to do. Well, I think it's a good opportunity from the use skills and as well, Christine mentioned, about dealing with change and learning to be more flexible. I think it's a good environment to do that. Yep. He's not so taxed at doing his work that he can't learn some social skills. So, because the job is something that maybe isn't challenging enough, like you said, then he could work on some of these other kinds of- Right. ... Yeah, interpersonal skills. Great. Okay. You mentioned volunteering. So does he volunteer in the community? Can you tell me a little bit about that? So through school they volunteer at the food pantries and basically just stocking, they put bags together for people who come to get the food, so they're told, okay, you need to put X, Y, and Z in, and that's their job. They will also take, when a delivery comes in, they will also take- Organize. ... Organize the shelf. And he loves being there. I think sometimes there's so much going on that he gets a little thrown off. So, for instance, we heard that he jumped on boxes instead of tearing them apart appropriately because some other kid had done it and it was fun. And he saw the other kid do it, so he followed the other kid, Steven, you know that's not right, but. But he's good at that, from what we hear and he enjoys it. The other place is a place called Kitty Kingdom, which is a privately owned Chucky cheese. Okay. And the owner's very good in wanting to allow students with special needs to come in and work. So they go there and they clean the machines and they mop the floors. Arrange tables and chairs. And they go there... Well, food pantry it's either or. You do the food pantry or do you do Kitty Kingdom. So it's once a week And it's all volunteer work? Mm-hmm. So does he go with other students from the school? Yes. Right. And the job coach  So I don't know if a job coach goes, but there's definitely a teacher and a para. Oh, okay. And how do they get there? They either take school transportation, a van or they take public transportation. Okay. Great. All right. So the travel training is part of the program. How do we get from high school to wherever we're going? And I think they have to transfer two buses for that one. Yes. That's great. Okay. Travel training. All right. Great. That's it for this one. I mean, there's other things that he volunteers doing. He does some work in the library bookmobile. Skokie library? Yes. He isn't doing that anymore though. Yeah. Gail's not there. So there was a librarian who really took a liking to Steven. Yeah. He loves bookmobile. And so she found tasks for him to do, but she retired. So, that was kind of sad. Yeah. He would take, I guess the books are stickered dates when they come on and so at some point the stickers need to be removed. So he'd have to go and look for all the stickers with sixes, and then he would take them off the books and she was there to kind of oversee that. He loved doing that. He did like doing that and then she retired. So, that was kind of sad. That's too bad. And then he volunteers at the school concession stand. Oh, okay. And he volunteers at church doing some AV work and then helping out with some of the younger kids. Okay. Trying to think if there's anything else. Busy. That's about it. Great. Okay, great. Thank you. Yeah, he's got a lot going on. That sounds good. Hopefully he'll get to have a new job soon. Yeah. Considering when's his birthday did you say it was? August 1st. August. Okay. Okay. So that's kind of nice. He's got the rest of the school year and then is he there for the summer as well? I'm not a hundred percent sure how it works. Well, that's the plan. However, this school district, they don't, their teachers don't stay on for the summer. So it's a different group of teachers who don't necessarily know the program. And then we're dealing with different staff who don't know Steven and- That tough. ... Yeah. So we're kind of still deciding whether it's, is it going to be more of a hassle to have them in there or is it, do we keep them in until the bitter end, you know? Right. Yeah. So yeah, that's to be decided we're still working on that one. TBD right. Yeah. Okay. Great. Well, thank you.\n",
            "finishAll right. This is participant 2-0-2-6, February 19th. So you said that Liam is not still in high school? Is he in a transition program? No, he's 22, right? He's not in a- He's done with all. Okay. Did he work during high school? He did. Okay. About how many jobs did he have? He had one job. Mm-hmm . With the Park District. Okay. Two nights a week. Park District. What community? Naperville. Thank you. Oh, great. You guys are right there. How did he find that job? I had a connection. Networking always helps. Yes. Did you just tell me how many hours on average? It was two nights a week, two to three hours. Two to three hours. Okay. Like five until seven or something like that? Two nights a week so? Two nights a week. It was like a Tuesday, Thursday, or Wednesday, Friday or something. I forget the exact day but- Do you remember sort of the... If you can, the month and the year he began working there? Well, it would've been May of '14. Okay. Through August of '16, when he graduated high school, it ended. Great. Can you tell me a little bit what he did? Job duties, job title? Well, I'd call it general maintenance. I mean, sweeping buildings, taking that garbage, wiping down tables, floors. He was basically the end of day cleanup crew for a couple buildings. Mm-hmm . I don't know what you'd call that, but- General maintenance, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm always careful of the maintenance word because he didn't put in light bulbs or fix screws. Okay. He was the garbage guy, the table cleaner. Put the chairs back, move the tables around, that kind of stuff. All right. Okay. Did he receive support when he was doing this job? Like job coaching? Yeah. Anything like that? Okay. Do you think it was a good fit for his skills and interests? Skills? Yes. Interests? No. Can you tell me why? Both. Skills? He's a good rule follower. He a direction follower so I mean, he did it. Interest? I don't know that he knows what his interest is. We'll see what he says, but I mean, he'd tell he wants to be a sports announcer, so no, he didn't want to be a maintenance guy. Okay. Yeah. I don't know if he has realistic interests but- Sports announcer, interesting. We'll see what he says. Exactly.  We'll see what he says. Who knows that might have changed too these days but... Did he volunteer in the community during high school? No. Okay. All right. So the rest of this I'm going to ask about after he graduated from high school. Okay. So can you tell me a little bit about, so I just want to get an idea of how he spends his time. What does a typical week look like for Liam? Like right now? Right now. Well, he's working Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8:00 until 12:00. Okay. I mean, that's his biggest commitment because by the time we leave at 6:30, he's home at 1:00 so- Sure, yeah. So Tuesdays and Thursdays are heavily with work from 6:00 to 1:00, basically from commute time. The rest of the time he... Literally, it's get up, hang around the house, and then twice a week, he works out with my wife and they go to fitness facility just to keep him moving. Mm-hmm . And then depending on the night of the week, we try to fill it with activities mainly through  at WDSRA, the Special Rec. Mm-hmm . So Monday night, he bowls. Okay. Any of their social outings, not any, most of their sports outings, he'll go to. Okay. Blackhawks game, Bulls game, and then he loves- He likes his sports. He loves sports. Okay. Okay, and then a ton of TV watching. Not sure it's good or not, but a ton of TV watching. I mean, he will, he'll veg in front of the tube all day if you let him. Okay. Is that what you wanted? That's exactly what I wanted. Currently not in any post-secondary education programs? Not currently. Not currently. Okay. Yeah. We'll talk about, I'll ask you about the other one. Okay. And is he getting paid where he is now? Yes. Okay. And does he... Yeah, okay. Is it supported employment? Does he have- So I don't know how to define that. Okay. That's why I want to get your classes. Yeah, exactly. I mean, he does not have a day to day job, coach, so you tell  me what it's called, but we did get the job through Aspire. You might know Aspire here. I mean, I did a lot of work with them on their Career Academy. Mm-hmm . The first 90 days, he had a DRS rep and they got paid for a... what they call it? Milestone? Okay. I think he got paid for a milestone. He made 90 days. Sure, sure. But after that, I mean all coaching has dropped off. Okay. Okay. Is it- sorry? I think it's independent. I mean- Yeah.  It's competitive employment. It's competitive employment, for sure. I mean, he's on a crew. He's their only person I'm aware of with a disability and there's no job coach day to day. Okay, great. And I'll ask you a little more specifics about that in a minute. Yeah. No, good. Great. Okay. We're learning whether it was a good setup or not. It's a debate.  Debate. Exactly. Okay, great. So thinking about postsecondary, so he has been... He's not currently in something, but what was he in before? You said Iowa. Yeah. He went to the University of Iowa program called REACH. I don't know if you've heard of it. I have some guesses about what it is, I have. I think I worked at one that's similar here in Illinois. Can you tell me a little bit about it? Yeah. It's a two year certificate program. Okay. Very similar to Elmhurst except it's a four year program. Elmhurst is four. You mean the ELSA program? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, very similar. So Iowa is called REACH, Realizing Education and Career Helps. Okay, great. . That's the REACH. So he lived in the dorms- It is like... Where I worked at PACE. You know the PACE program? Yeah, that's National Louis, right?  So we looked into all of them, Started my career. We looked into all of them and then just went to the Iowa one instead. So living in dorms... So similar like taking classes in skills and things like that? All of the above, yep. 50 kids are in the program, ages... He was one of the younger ones, but ages were probably 19 to 24 or 25. Yeah. Dorm living, campus lifestyle, regular dorm floors, they had them all on one floor, but with an RA. Sure. There was an RA just for the REACH program, but... Cafeteria was the same. Did he- Hold on. Yeah. Did he have a specific area study? Did it work like that? I don't want to assume. It didn't. So basically everybody took the same life skills classes. Your second year, you did get to pick an internship, so he worked in the electrical departments- Okay. Warehouse. Taking stuff off the shelf, giving it to the electricians, putting stuff back, opening UPS boxes, that kind of stuff. That was his internship. When he went, how many classes did they have them do each semester? Do you remember? 16. Full 16 hours. So four- 16 hours. Yeah. Four classes each semester. Pretty, pretty mixed. There was always something that had math. There was always something that had daily living skills. There was always one that was tied to fitness. Mm-hmm  Yeah. So we got our healthy living. We got our, yeah.  We've got our math, consumer math- Same stuff. Can you tell me the day, the month and year when he started and when he finished? He went August '16, so Fall of '16 when Iowa started and then he only did the two years. So he graduated in May of '18. Is that right? Great. 16 to 17. 17 to 18. Yeah. Great. Graduated. If you ask him, did he want to do a third year? He'll say, \"Yes.\" I'll tell him that would've been a very expensive party. Yes. I'm interested because actually with this assessment, Christina does, there's parts for her to ask him about these. Okay. About this as well, so let's see what he says. Good. So it asked what kind of supports he received. I'm guessing that the whole program was like a modified program for people with disabilities. Oh, yeah. Or were there extra supports on top of that, like modified curriculum or a tutor or things like that? No.  That's  I just want to make sure- He wasn't even... They don't structure. I think you answered your question. Yes. All of his classes were REACH classes, so they're already modified for the REACH students. He was never in like Calculus and then they modified the curriculum or something for him. No. Great. Okay. Any additional comments about this program? That you weren't happy that you haven't said?  In terms of? Anything. Well, I'm a huge fan of it. I mean, I think it taught him a lot of independent living skills. I also think it taught him a lot of bad habits. Some of them we're still dealing with. They lacked... I love the program and they know this, not that you're evaluating their program, they lacked a little bit of day to day supervision to these guys and they're fixing that. So I think, while it was cool for what he learned, independence, inclusive, he definitely picked up a lot of collegiate bad habits. Sure. And with the autism and the disabilities... God, unwinding these is hard. Yeah. Yeah, you've probably been working on it since he got out. Yeah. I mean, we tell people like, \"Are you glad you sent him?\" And I say, \"Absolutely. I'm glad. We're glad we sent him, we think he totally matured.\" But boy, we didn't think of some of the stuff he would've picked up where, it's his word statements, sayings, things you say to the 21 year olds that you shouldn't be saying to me or you. Right. And he just doesn't register, like you're not on the dorm floor anymore. Right. You've been out two years. It's like- Ahh. You'll get to work, but it kind of happened at work. He told the supervisor what he thought of him, like, \"Dude, you can't do that.\" No, no. Did he get fired or? We took two weeks off, how's that? Okay. A little punishment. He's that- I don't even know if we called it punishment. Just he can't do that. I mean, they were very nice of about it, but you know- I'm excited to hear more about this place because that's great. Yeah. That's great. All right. Great. Any other school or program like that, that he attended after high school? No. Okay. All right. I mean, do you want to count to the Aspire Career Academy or no? Yeah. Okay. So after Iowa, we did have... I don't know if you know about the Career Academy down in Aspire, right here... Why  blank? It's right off 2-90. Anyway, it's just a little 12 week- Chicago or? Yeah, right here. So Aspire.org. Jim Kales is the CEO. I've done a lot of work with them, so they have a career academy. It's basically a 12 week program. I think he went three days a week. Effectively, we pre-train. I say \"We\", I'm not a teacher there. I helped set it up. They pre-train. So they have a warehouse setting, they have an office setting, they have a hotel setting. So they put you through 12 weeks. They have a restaurant setting, waiting tables and stuff, not cooking, but everything but cooking, they put students through. Okay. Effectively, a vocational assessment, right? Are you good at restaurants? You get the idea is that you get trained on a specific task that they help place you, so that's how we found his job at Canteen, was through them. Yeah. I'm familiar with the larger, like the big Aspire, but I've never heard of this particular program. . Yeah, so they, yeah. When we're done, you can look it up, right . I mean, he's got, they've got education, they've got housing and then they've got their career and living. Okay. That's kind of now how Jim structured his three divisions. Okay, yeah. I wasn't in the- I don't care about the pre... I care, but I wasn't part of pre-K. Yes. I'm going to housing. Career living is where they're probably the smallest, but trying to grow. Okay. Yeah. You're in this field, so he shut... I love the dude. Jim Kales is the CEO. He shut down their sheltered workshop. Okay. And we did some fundraising and built this career academy. It's beautiful. If you haven't toured it, you should. I'm going to look into it. It's beautiful, and they're still trying to grow the program, get more people to know about it. But the whole idea is the partner with companies. Right. So get in, partner, place. Yeah. So he took the resources from the sheltered workshop and started this instead, as an alternative. And everybody that was in the workshop, he actually found a way to basically evaluate them all. And if they were super impacted. Yes. Yeah. Kind of put them on the 20 year track. We're just going to probably teach you life skills still. Sure, sure. Folks that were in the middle, talk to their families about, \"Could we ever get them to wait tables?\" Right. It might take us two years, but let's work on that. And then folks like Liam, we try to get in and get out, get in 12 weeks, learn something, let's place you. It can get you somewhere, and get you working. It's the whole idea. I mean, I could send you the video that they did when the TV station went, if you want of Liam. But anyway. Oh yes, that would be great. Cool concept. I was part of the founder. We had a bunch of people that helped. I think they're doing really well. As a user of it, and Jim knows this, the part that they're missing is the, once I've placed you, what's my role? When this kid gets into services, right? I mean, , where do you cut? I mean, he doesn't have unlimited resources to stay with the Liam. So Liam gets placed by them, but after six months, he's now no longer doing his job well. He's telling his boss off. Yes. You get to that, like what a tough predicament to settle, right? Like who does that? That's when there's those gaps that we need to fill. Yeah. So anyway, so that's our story. I mean, I had some  wherever you want, I'm happy to share it all. Okay. That's kind of where we are is we've got this highly... You'll see. I mean, he's certainly impacted on intellectual disability, but does okay functioning. Got it. But you get to these points like after Iowa for a while, he needed some help. After his job, he needed some help. Where's that help come from? Yes. And that's what the programs about and he gets resources. So what about, so when he was in this program, did he have a specific area of study- At Aspire?  Like a vocational area that he was leaning on? At Aspire? He eventually became what they would call the warehouse guy. Warehouse? Warehouse. And then- Order picker, warehouse kind of stuff. Okay. So I'm just going to put warehouse skills. What about average number of class? How was it set up in terms of- I don't know if he did classes. Three days a week, like three hour sessions. That's great. I don't think he did the three hours. Okay. And then do you remember when you started this program, the month and year? We'll... See, it's back in this, graduated May of '18 and he started work at Canteen in May of '19. So you'd be safe to say early calendar '19. Okay. I don't know if it was January or February. I'll just put January. And when did he leave? I know you just said it but-  So he was in Aspire probably January '19, they'll call it April of '19. Okay, thank you. And then he started working. That's a shared waiting area, if you're wondering what's going on out there. In the dungeon down there? Yeah. There's actually like another door with a hallway and a couple more offices even deeper. Oh, geez. So did he receive support from the program? So you're saying he didn't get a job . He didn't have a job coach when he left. He was placed. Yeah. You're going to have to define it. I mean- When he was,  I guess, what I'm wondering- For the first three or four weeks, somebody from Aspire went out. Okay. Maybe one day out of his two days a week. It was not 24/7, make sure he does everything. Okay. Yes, they went the first day. Yes, they went the second day. By the third week, checked in once or twice. And then after, like the third or fourth week, they never went back. Got it. Got it. Got it. So I don't know what that's called. Fading. They faded the supports. Yeah. And then the program itself was obviously, again like the other one, it's a modified. It's a for people with disabilities. Totally. 100%. I mean, Liam was probably one of their higher functioning folks. Okay. I mean, I love it dearly. They've got a lot of severe folks that... The different issues than I got. That's right. And yeah, we've seen all, everything through this program, so... Okay, so now, we know he is currently working. I'm ready to ask... Canteen, how do I spell it, first of all? Where he works now. Canteen. C-A-N-T-E-E-N. Okay. And can you kind of tell me what he does? So he is... You're going to go back to general maintenance. He is, very limited order picking so don't make that number one. They did hire him for that, but he's not doing that well at it. Mm-hmm . So that's like bottom now. Okay. It started as his top. It's moved. He's basically, he makes box- I don't know what you want to call this? I mean, he makes boxes for them, so he is building boxes, taping them up. He's unloading trucks. Okay. Putting stuff on shelves. And then literally he's... I don't, I mean, I guess I'm going to call it cleaning. I mean, it's a warehouse, so he runs their Zamboni. They have the push Zamboni, goes up and down the aisle, he's got a clean- Oh, and I always wanted to drive one of those. Yeah. He does it. It's a push, not a drive. He doesn't have a driver's license. Okay. So I don't know what you call that. Yeah. And then when the trucks come back in, he helps empty the trucks and he sweeps them out. So it's a little bit of cleaning. It's a very little order picking, which I want him to do more of, but he's not doing very well at that. And then it's... whatever you'd call box making. Yeah, just assembling boxes. It's that. Yeah. I mean, literally like... So they gave him a calendar, a schedule to keep while he is there, to try to keep him on task and an hour ahead and a half of his four hours is making these boxes like- Okay. Make 30, make 20 of this size, make 30 of this size. Okay. At the end of the day, I get a vision. There's a pile of boxes that they're loading coffee into. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great. Okay. And then is he paid? He's paid for this? Okay. 11 bucks an hour. And I know how he found it. How many weeks, hours per week does he work? We just cut it. So right now, he's eight. If you're trying to get for the research purposes, from May of '19 until... What are we in? February? Until mid-January of '20. He was 14. Okay. And that's when they pinged us and said, \"He's totally off task. He's roaming around.\" And so we met with him and said, \"Let's try shrinking in the hours and being more finite about what he does.\" Okay. Too much leeway. Yes. So he was just roaming- Literally, he is in the snack room for an hour, just eating. Okay, so he got called out? A little bit. No, he called out but in fairness to him, like... Oh yeah. Without the supports, I mean, they probably... As the woman, Laurie, his boss is great but she probably said, \"Go work with Jose.\" It's a guy's name. Without any explicit instructions? Jose said \"Go clean the trucks.\" Okay. Yeah, yeah. No, no, no, absolutely. He swept the truck and went in the snack room. Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, what else is we going to do? Exactly. So, okay, great. And then you kind of answered some of these for me already. You told me how he got it. Okay. Has he had any other employment since leaving high school? No. Great.\n",
            "finishOkay, this is participant 2024. It's February 20th and we're starting with vocational index. Okay. So we'll start with just asking you, is Ben still in high school? No. Okay. I didn't think so. And while he was in high school, did he ever work? No. Okay. And did he volunteer in the community during high school? Yeah. Okay. Can you tell me a little what he did or where? Yeah, at our church. He helped with the greeting. He was a greeter. That's when people are coming in for the service, right? Yes. And says hello, hands out the bulletin or whatever of the program. Yeah. And he would open the door and hold it open for people walking in the front door. Okay. And he'd say \"hi\" and smile. Ben is actually very social. So he loves people and loves to help. So feel needed like that. He loved it. Yeah. Well, good then. I hope I talked up that he's actually really helping us a lot today by being here. Okay. So that's all I'm going to ask you about high school time. Now, the rest of the interview, we're going to talk about after high school. Okay. So what I want to start off with is can you just tell me what a typical week is for Ben, including any kind of work, school or any activities that he does during the week? Okay. So he's at Shepherds College. Okay. And it's a full-time school. He's there 24/7 and they have nursing there Monday through Friday. And then they have their resident life program. They're there 24 hours a day. So that's what makes him eligible to be there because of the medical and the constant support. So he gets up at 6:15 AM by his alarm, he gets dressed, makes his bed and then he comes out for breakfast, out to the dorm kitchen. Is this the place in Wisconsin? Yeah. Okay. We have a couple other family. Oh, that's right. You know the other family. Okay. I forgot that he goes there as well. Yeah. Okay. All right. Right. And so what we've recently just done with Ben, because Ben works with just routine because he is in a constant state of memory loss. So Ben goes out, he puts a bagel in the toaster. Then while he does that, he gets the sausage on his plate and gets the peanut butter out. And when it pops up, he spreads peanut butter on it. And if he gets it all done by 7:15 AM, he's allowed to have a cup of coffee. Okay. Decaf. Okay. So because of the brain and all that. Yeah. So he got turned on to decaf coffee at college. Great. But yeah. He just told me this morning that he misses it a couple times. He doesn't get it every morning. But anyway, the whole goal is to keep him moving and to keep him on track. But anyway, then he has his breakfast and they give him his meds. He goes back, brushes his teeth and then he has chores before he goes to class. So there's a chart outside his bathroom door. He shares it with his roommate and he either cleans a toilet or he wipes down the sink. So it alternates, I think every morning. And then he has a couple minutes to chill out such as maybe 10 to 15 minutes and then they all leave, and go to class. And how many hours? So it is classes every day, Monday through Friday. Yeah. Okay. Full-time? Yeah. Nine to three. And it's mostly learning daily living skills and he is going to learn to trade. So he picked horticulture. So it's an accredited school and he'll get a certification at the end of three years for that. But they're learning life skills. They learn about professional development, so to speak and all of that. And they all have a locker and he goes to his locker and gets his binder. And then he starts going to his classes and follows the schedule. When the bell rings, he goes to the next one. Then in the middle of the day, he'll have lunch for half an hour. And then he gets to go to the gym for half hour. Then, back to class. Then at three o'clock when classes are done, they go back to their dorm. They have a little bit of downtime and then they have just like free time in the dorm. Okay. Ben will probably for two to four days a week take a nap. Not everybody does that, but Ben's neurologist highly recommends that he does that. Because it prevents seizures to give that brain some rest. Sure. So he'll typically take a nap even if it's just 20 minutes and then dinner's at 5:30 PM. There's a chores list for that too or a chart. And sometimes there's so many guys in the dorm that they don't always have to either prep or tear down for dinner. But he might have one of those. And then he goes and takes a shower and comes back and has more free time. And they'll have a snack at like 8 or 8:30 at night. It's really cute. Yeah. And he gets his evening meds and then brushes his teeth in dorm, gets into bed, sits up and reads for maybe 10 to 15 minutes, and then lights out. And what about vocational? Do they do any vocational work with the students? Does he have a job on campus? No, he doesn't have a job on campus, but this would be considered under DHS. It would be vocational rehab. So it's job preparation. So that's where the daily living skills or professional development come. He's learning his trade and they learn other things such as he has a money management class. So learning how to budget and every student when they get there, they open up a checking account, and of course the parents do it. Sure, sure. There's a bank two blocks from the school. They use that bank and then we deposit a fixed amount of money every month. And then Ben will write a check to I think probably either the bank or to his advisor or something. Okay. And then they'll go and get the money out and then they help them budget it throughout the month. And each student has an advisor. So they meet with the advisor once a week and they go over things and say things such as, \"I'm running low on shampoo\" or \"I need a haircut.\" Yes. So things like that. And so that gets worked into the budget. And then also once a month, I think as with their advisor during advising, they'll sign for activities for the weekend. And let's say he signs up for bowling. Then some of that money will be drawn out of his budget. So he has to really learn how to budget. Yes. Yeah. And if he wants snacks while he's there. Things like that. That all comes out of his budget. Okay. Great. So, okay. So you said horticulture is his area? Yes. Do you know the average number of classes they take per semester or how that breaks down? I know it's full-time. Yeah. I think they have three or four classes in the morning before lunch. And they also have chapel in there once a week, I think. And then in the afternoon, I think it's two or three. So anywhere from five to seven classes? I'd say, yeah. I don't have a scheduled in front of me. It's okay. But so the first semester of their first year they get a taste of all three of the different majors. Oh, okay. And then over Christmas break, they're required to sit down and think about it. They give us little information to help and then they have to declare their major. Okay. So Ben did a really good job of processing through that. I was impressed. And of the three majors, Tony and I always felt that horticulture would be best for him. But he came to that conclusion on his own, which was great. So, yeah. And so now that he's in his major, I think they actually have like lengthy periods of time. The afternoon is an hour and a half per class. So that's why I think there's just two in the afternoon. And, and then they're in their major for the most part. And just two to three days a week. I know Tuesdays and Thursdays, they have other classes. Okay. But they don't do any jobs? He doesn't go out into the community and does a job a couple hours in a day? Nothing like that? No. Okay. I just wanted to double check. Because this is all vocational. Yeah. This is to prepare him for that. Okay. Yep. Do you remember the month and year he started program? Yeah. August of 2019. Of this year? Okay. Great. Okay. And were there any other schools or programs that he has attended since he graduated high school? No. Wait a minute. Program. I kind of fell into it, but I've discovered a day program. It's called Synapse house and it's in Elmhurst. It is strictly for day rehab for anybody with acquired brain injury, TBI, stroke, or recovering from any of those. Yeah. And so he loves it and I was a little concerned, but so when he's home on break, he goes to his day program. Can you tell me a little bit about what they do there? Yes, they have an OT onsite who helps a lot. Okay. I'm still learning about it because he's been there three weeks over Christmas break, so I'm still learning. But they take maybe a week to assess the individual kind of, and then they all get a binder. Okay. And so when they come in, they pick up their binder and they open it and shows you that this is what you do today. Okay. So they push the brain really hard. And then they give it rest. And that's really how you rehab a brain. You push it and then rest it. Push it and rest it. So every day of the week, they do different things. One might be in which they call it cognitive rehab, and so based on where they're at developmentally. And it's for ages 16 to 75. They'll have word problems and he has to read it. And maybe he has to try to understand the concept of the paragraph or what this word means, what that word means or what do you think. He tells me that is really hard. So that's really good. That is good. He's able to tell you that it's hard. Yeah. They do exercises every day for 30 minutes. They all work on lunch together. You can either pack it or you can buy a lunch there for $3 a day. And so they might make like potato soup and a salad. So they all pitch in and help, which is again, daily living skills. Sure. Yeah. And what else do they do? They even spend some time. Once a week, they'll have a section of time where they talk about conflicts that came up maybe between them during the week. And they learn how to work that out. They'll have a session where it's like a group therapy session in a sense. There's a lot more to it, but I'm still learning like I said. Yeah. This is great. Yeah. And in addition, there's this F-L-O-U-R, Flour to Empower Bakery. They're located actually in an old pizza restaurant that probably went down. Yes. And so one half is where the kitchen is and the pizza ovens is the bakery side. So when you walk in the front door, it's like you're walking into a restaurant. So on the right where the tables used to be, that's Synapse House's side. Flour to Empower Bakery's on the other side, but it's all one. Wow. Yeah. And so they take orders and work in the bakery. And so really good rehab. Does Ben do some of those activities? Yeah. Yep. And of course he never uses the oven. Ben's not allowed to be near an oven, a hot stove top or anything hot because of the seizures. Sure, sure. But you can measure and stir, and so they take orders. It's not a daily bakery. It's not that people come in and give a donut. It's not that type. They make breads, brownies and cookies. And then for large events, you can order it for Christmas or something like that. So they're really growing into who they are. Wow. But it's a phenomenal agency. And he goes there during breaks. About how many hours would you say he's usually there when he goes? Okay. So I drop him off at 8:30 in the morning and I pick him up around 3:00 PM. So six and a half. Okay. So about 30? Yeah it'd be about 33. I'm going to round up. Sure. Sure. And I've decided now that we've had a taste of it that over his summer break when he is home for two months, I'm going to send him four days a week instead of five. So he gets a break and so I have time with him. Because now that he's stable, we can start doing things and we haven't been able to do anything over all these years. Sure, sure. We take him out in the community and boom. Seizures. Sure. So I want to take him to the fire station and just things like that he loves. You want to get to it. You want to start enjoying life. Yeah. Did he start this program just this winter break? When did he first go to Synapse House? He did. So was it December? Yeah, December 23rd actually was his first day. And then his last day was January 16th. Okay. And I'm going to say he's currently enrolled because you're going to bring him back there for the summer. Oh yeah. We've got a plan with them. Oh, that's the other thing. They were working on memory with Ben and that is going to be a big goal with him which is to teach him. They're going to use his phone. They're teaching him how to set alarms in his phone for 10 o'clock you do this, and 11:30 whatever. And they're working hard on memory. Oh. They also said the OT loves him. They just see so much potential in him. So they want to start taking him into the community. Great. They want to take him to the public library and Elmhurst and I think to volunteer there and to learn proper social engagement and social skills. Okay. Because Ben always wants to talk about Avengers or something. They're going to help him learn how to converse back and forth. Yes. Because he has some language disorders from the brain injury. Right, right. So I don't know if we get into that later- So they're going to work on...oh yeah. We're going to get into all of it. Okay, great. Yeah. Okay. Great. So what's going to happen is actually, Christina will get a chance to ask Ben his thoughts about these programs as well. Oh good. So that'll be nice. That should be interesting. That's part of what we do here too. Yeah. Okay. Interesting. Great. So wow. The Synapse House sounds like a really interesting place. Yeah. I just thought of something else too. She recognized leadership potential in him first day. And I was like, \"somebody got it.\" Because a lot of people don't see it but it's there in living color. And when we were in Ohio, he was at this little private school there. And they did TaeKwonDo to help brain crossover and to calm them down. And so he just fell in love with it. And so to this day, he talks about it. That's one of the things he's actually remembered that really stuck in his memory and impacted him. So he started telling the OT about it. So she latched onto that right away. And so he's leading a TaeKwonDo class there. Wow. And I've got the videos, because I asked her and said, \"can you videotape him? Because I want to see it.\" He's a whole different person when he's teaching. He's so adult. He is real calm. I bet that's amazing for you to see. Oh it is. It's just amazing. After we get done, can I see those? Yeah. You can see right now. Yeah. I don't want to- No it's okay. We just finished this one. So I'll switch the other while you guys look. Yeah. I'll just show it to her. I'll-\n",
            "finishAbout activities that Stewart's been involved in, and talk a little bit more about what he's doing now. So I'm going to be asking you a little bit more about the Jewetts job. Mm-hmm . But first we're starting off by talking about high school experiences. So, can you tell me a little bit about, so he is currently in the transition program. When did Stewart finish the regular program in high school and start transition? It's been a year and a few months, so I don't know what year that would be. Okay. Yeah. He's he grad... Well, he didn't officially graduate yet, but he didn't get his diploma because he is in the transition program. So, it's this school year and last school year that he's been out of high school. Mm-hmm . Okay. Thank you. And did any of his high school tracks, track or plans change since we last spoke? Yes. He's now going to college. He did. And it wasn't successful. Where did he, where did he try going? College of DuPag. Okay. Okay. I'm going to probably ask you more about that in a minute. Okay. Put that here for now. And when is he planning on finishing or exiting high school all together? Right now, the plan is up until age 22, which is the cutoff. It could be sooner, but you know, I feel there's still a lot more to learn for him. Okay. He could benefit from attending the transition program And what year would that be? 2022, right? You're doing the math? He's actually 19 now, he'll be 20. He'll be 20 in June. This June, of this year, '21. Oh, okay. So '22. So not till '23, I believe, 2023. Okay, great. Okay. And so you've answered some of this. Okay, does Stewart receive payment at both of his jobs? Yes. Okay. So I'm going to ask about Jewetts first. Mm-hmm . Okay so, the Jewetts job, how did he find the job? Through the transition program. Okay. They have connection with the manager who has an understanding and is willing to hire on kids with disabilities. Okay. I feel like Jewetts in general just has good track record with that. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I mean we tried, thought maybe we could do some other options. And what we were told at the transition program is, people will say what their experiences, like say Walmart that they'll say, yeah, well, we'll hire them on. He said, but they don't really understand the dynamics involved. And then they just don't have the patience. And then, they don't last, the employee doesn't last. So, but this particular manager, this Jewetts, they have a relationship with... They wanted Stewart to be successful. So, and he has been extremely successful. Oh, that's so good to hear. Yeah. That's so great. How many hours a week does he usually work there? Maybe 15. Okay. And do you remember when he started, you said fall. Can you give me, is it like September, October? I'd say October. Mm-hmm . Okay, great. And is it part of school programming? I know they found him the job, but is it considered part of the school programming? What do you mean? I don't think it is, but... Okay. I mean like some transition programs have the youth in like three different internships at three different places sort of as part of their program, you know what I mean? No. No. Mm-mm . Okay. Okay, great. And can you tell me a little bit about what he does on the job? He, well, he started off as just pushing carts in, going out into the parking lot and pushing them in and he didn't really like that. And now he is a cashier and I would've never thought that, because it would, I thought, oh my gosh, all that's involved, but he's doing it and he likes it. Good for him. Mm-hmm . Okay. Does he receive support while he's working? No. Mm-mm . Okay. And do you think this job is a fit for his skills and interests? I do. Yeah. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about why? I don't know why. I don't really, I mean, he, I wouldn't have thought that, because Chuck E. Cheese is what he likes, but I think the people are nice to him. Oh, he likes the fact that Jewetts' been around for a long time. He likes things, they're old, he likes to do the research to... They were once owned by, I don't know what they were called. So he likes that dynamic that they've been around for a long time. So, and he likes the fact that the employees have been there a long time because then he can talk to them about different things that happened there. So I think all that interests him. And I think his self confidence has boosted a lot because he's been very successful in the register, cashier, and he knows he's got, I shouldn't say, I mean the supports are there, but it's unintentional. It's the people that are there, that have been there a long time that are just, the cashiers are like, if you need help Stewart, you just tell me. They're very nurturing to him. So, and because of that, he's been successful. And he doesn't get bothered by customers that are mad. It doesn't bother him. He'll be really nice to him. He doesn't take it for personally. Yeah. I'm like, thank goodness. Because as a cashier, especially during the holidays, it can be crazy. And people are just so weird with COVID too. Yeah. In terms of being at the grocery store, some people just want to get out of there. Yeah. Different, sort of levels of stress I think. Yeah. Oh yeah. Great. So talking about Chuck E. Cheese, I know he's paid. Can you remind me about how many hours a week? Well, he might get maybe 10. Okay. And what does he do there? You know, he does a lot. He doesn't, he's not a cashier, but he'll, it's a kid check. He fixes the games. He'll cook, he'll be in the kitchen and cook. He cleans a lot for them. Okay, great. And does he get any supports on that job? No. Mm-mm . Great. Okay. And would you say that it's a good fit? Yeah, for sure. It's a high interest, right? High interest. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Okay, great. And can you remind me about when he started that job? He was 16. So 16, 17, 18, it's probably going on three years. Okay. So, it's 2017 about there? Yeah. Okay. Has he worked and left any jobs since we spoke last year? No. Mm-mm . Okay. And has he volunteered in the community at all since we spoke last? No. Okay. All right. Thank you. That is, I think it for this one, I feel like I'm missing something, but I'm not. Great. So is there anything else you want to add before we say goodbye? Any other updates that we didn't talk about? No. No. That's.\n",
            "finishTalking about high school, we just want to hear about his high school experience. And I know he's not in high school anymore, but we're just asking you to describe the situation. When did he graduate? Did he go into transition? I know Ben's what? He's 23... How old is Ben? 23, yeah? Correct. 23. Yeah. Can you tell me about his high school situation and receiving services through the high school, when that stopped? Yeah. Well, Ben was out placed. He was in an outplacement school for the whole time we've been in Illinois. We moved from Ohio to Illinois when Ben was in eighth grade and he started right out in outplacement. And so then he went into transition after... He turned 18 December, so the following school year, he went into transition. And then finished, I think at 21. Yes, because he started school at Shepherd's that fall. The fall of whatever year, age, however old he was at 21. Would that be 2019, maybe 2018? Yeah, 2019. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, 2019. And have to ask this, did Ben's high school track or plans change since we last spoke? No, because he's not in high school. So he finished then completely in May 2019. Was it about May or June? Early June. Early June. Okay, great. Okay. And so that he went to summer school that summer. Okay. Yeah. ESY. He had ESY that summer. So he was done at the end of July. Okay. Okay. July 2019, thank you. And one second, just getting these in there. And when he finished high school, did he have a regular diploma? Occupational diploma? Certificate of completion? Certificate of completion. Okay. Okay, great. And then the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs and employment and volunteering that he may have done since we spoke last year. Okay. So can you tell me what a typical week looks like for Ben at this time? Yeah. Let's see. So he sets his alarm at night to get up at 6:30 AM. And then Saturdays, they let him sleep for an hour. So he's up at 7:30 AM on Saturday, but he has to set his alarm. And then he gets up, he gets dressed. He has to be out in the kitchen and have his breakfast ready to eat by 7:15 if he wants to have coffee because he loves coffee. And so decaf. He got turned on to coffee while he was at school last year. But it has to be decaf according to the doctor. And then after breakfast they clean up after themselves. He has a morning chore. It's usually either clean the toilet or clean the vanity in his shared bathroom with his roommate. Make his bed, has area tidied up. And then they have... If he finishes on time, he has about 25 minutes just to sit and chill out until they leave for class for 9:00. So they leave their hall at about 8:50 or 8:55. So they're in class by 9:00. Then he goes through morning classes. They have lunch at noon with COVID it's brought back to their hall. Nobody goes to the cafeteria. And then after lunch they give him a little time to relax and then they go afternoon classes until 3:00. And then some... Yeah. Then after that, he might meet with his advisor for budgeting. Or for a club. He's in a spiritual formation club. He's in a Wacky Wednesday, Fun Friday. There's been some crazy club. It's like some crazy games, or something. I don't know. That's on Monday. Okay. So does he attend class every day? Yes. Five days a week. Yes. Okay. Okay, great. So that's about 25 hours a week, right? Yeah. And they clock. They clock in and out. They have a barcode on their ID, which is on a... What do you call those things you wear around your neck of- Lanyard? Thank you. Sure. I knew it wasn't a  kind of thing. It clocks their hours. And when they come out of the classroom, they swipe again. Yeah. Great. Until their hours get logged. Yeah. Okay. And then when Ben is... When it's not COVID time, I'm just curious. Do they engage in vocational activities, outside in the community as part of Shepherd's? Or is that a different... That's not something they do. Yeah. They do do that. That's typically on a Friday night or a weekend. Now, they might do the shopping on a weekday if they're on rotation for that. They're either setting up for dinner, prepping with the side dish, prepping with the main dish, or shopping, or cleaning up after dinner. But does that answer your question? Well, I'm just wondering if they do any job training, or any job vocational workout? Well, okay. Well, so his major is horticulture. So during the day, probably one once or twice a week, he has a class for that. I think it's called pre-vocational, or something like that. And they do talk about interviews and they're required to dress a certain way for school every day, based on their major. So that they understand, \"This is how I would dress if I was in this job.\" And when they're in the classroom, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Ben has field experience from 8:30 to noon. So they wear different clothing for that. And then on the other days when they're just... Like Monday, Friday when they're in the classroom, they have to wear a certain type of shirt and pants. So it's like appropriate dress for work. And they also have interviews, they have mock interviews, stuff like that. So Ben has to have a suit with him there. And they have to give speeches once in a while. Now we're talking about a minute or two, but still, they're getting the experience. Yeah. It's great. Does he take any classes with others do without disabilities at Shepherd's or is it? No. It's all disabled. Yeah. It's a real wide range. Great.  Horticulture. And about how many classes does he take per semester? I'm going to say he is probably in five, five or six maybe. I have no idea. I'd have to pull out of his schedule. It's fine. But he's full-time, right? Yeah, yeah. Okay. And can you remember the month and year he started? You said fall 2019, was it? Yeah. I remember it was August 11, 2019. Great. Can you hear my dog? Yeah. I'm sorry. No, that's not... Love it. What do you have? I have a greyhound and he's staring out the window crying. I think he's trying to tell me something. Yeah. We're almost done. We're almost done. Do you think the program is a good fit for Ben? Tony and I go back and forth on that. I think so. I think, again, in this world of disabilities, we're not complaining at all. He's actually very fortunate to be there, because they only have like 70 something or 90, I think students per year. And the fact that Ben is considered has high enough independent living skills to go there. Yeah. We're really, really grate... Because there's nothing else like it out there. Right, right. Yeah. We wish there was something a little bit more tailored, because... Do you want me to tell you or am I going over? No, no, that's good. Okay. Okay. Because Ben... I'm going to say, I'll bet you hear this from other parents, but Ben's an anomaly. Ben, TBI is, even though it presents like autism, you cannot use the same interventions. They don't work. And so people see him... Let's say like the staff in the dorm, these guys are trained. They know what autism is. They see it every day. You know what I mean? But TBI and especially Ben's type of TBI. They don't. That's why I say it's an anomaly, because Ben's damage is perfuse. All over his brain. He's never the same two minutes in a row. The best way you can describe him is a moving target. And so it takes easily two years to understand him, easily, to get it. And so, we're a year and a half into school and they're finely just starting to get it. We're finely just hitting a baseline. We haven't even like gotten anywhere yet. You know what I'm saying? Mm-hmm . That's why Tony and I wish there was something out there that's like Shepherds only it would be like Synapse House on steroids. Where they can live there and be focused on, or have a greater understanding of TBI. Especially to that extent and help them. So that, for me, as his mother is the scariest part. As he lives into his future, and I'm not going to be around forever. So that's the hardest part. Well, I'm glad that... Okay, thank you. That's good. Synapse House is specifically for people who have traumatic brain injury? Yes. Yes. Synapse, that's the brain, that's the connection between neurotransmitters. Yeah. It connects... Yeah. So it creates pathways and that's where it got its name. And it's for TBI or acquired brain injury, which would be something that a baby got in the womb, like an addiction from- Mm-hmm . Okay. And then, or a stroke survivor. Okay. Is there anything else you want to share with me or any updates that we haven't talked about? That was our last question. No, I don't think so. Yeah. No, because... Yeah. And I told you about, he's being pulled from the  list. So I'm in the process of trying to figure that out. Good. And then before... Let me just put the... I'm just trying to figure out. Before we say goodbye, I am asking parents if they don't mind. If you don't mind, just updating-\n",
            "finishWell, so first I'm going to ask you, has he ever worked during high school? No, not till now. Okay. And so this is his first job he has now? Yes. Okay. Has he ever had an internship or anything that was part of high school programming? No. No. Okay. And does he get paid for this job that he has now? Yes. Okay. So if you could tell me the name of where he works, please. It's POP and I don't remember what the first P is for, something occupation. Hey, let me look. It's his- it's POP. It's like something Play Therapy, POP Forest. It's so funny. I should know what that, what time, I look at the sign every day Path Therapy, POP so POP Pediatric Therapy. Okay. Thank you. And how did he find this job? Well, so his developmental therapist who was doing some large motor and job type chore training for me at home with him, this guy is Mike Ruggles and he's been his developmental therapist since he was two. And so he's been with us now, Ryan's 17, so 15 years. And he is married to the woman who was Ryan's occupational therapist in early intervention. Okay. And so his wife, Nancy, Mike and Nancy, Nancy started a clinic. Nancy started POP. They opened this clinic about a year, year and a half ago. And I asked her if Ryan could get a job at her clinic on the weekend, on Sundays, and Mike would be his job coach. So basically Mike's hours that he used to spend here, teaching Ryan how to do chores are now at Nancy and Mike's clinic. Oh, wow. Teaching Ryan to do a job. He shreds things, empties the garbage, clean the ball pit. Stuff that needs to be done in the occupational therapy clinic. So Mike's still on my payroll, but Ryan's on their payroll. Got it. That worked out. He's earning quarters towards social security. So how many hours a week, then on average, does he work at this job? About an hour and a half. Okay, great. Not very much. Yep. That's okay. When did he start? I think we started last September. So about almost a year. Great. Yeah. This school year, he started his sophomore year. He was 16. Okay. So he was- I think we talked about it and then she, I think we got it up and running August or September. Okay. And you told me a little bit, you said he shreds things, empties the garbage. He shreds. What else is he-? Yeah. Mm-hmm . Empties the garbage. They clean the ball pit. They do some, he'll put things away. I don't know what else they do. Just general cleaning and maintenance. Okay. And does the developmental therapist work with him the whole time? Yes. Okay. Okay. Great. Okay. Last question about this. Do you think the job is a good fit for Ryan's skills and interests? Yes. He likes going there. Can you tell me a little more about why it's a good fit? He likes going there. Well, first of all, he is with someone who he is very familiar with. Second, he loves the physical building. Great. Mike knows him very well and knows his disabilities and also knows how to challenge him. Plus I think he feels useful and that he's learned skills and can do things, and he feels good at the end when he completed his tasks. Great. Okay. And one second, I can almost type as fast as you talk, but not quite. Okay. And has Ryan volunteered in the community during high school? No. Okay. Great. All right. That was it for this one. Okay. All right. So\n",
            "finishSo again, last time we spoke, we talked about some of the activities that Trevon had been involved in. So we're going to start talking about what he's doing now a little bit more in depth, and we're starting with talking about his high school experience. So can you describe one more time for me Trevon's high school situation, is he still in high school or receiving services through the school system? He's in the transition program because he completed high school and the high, the school system offers the transition program. Okay. From the age of 18 to 22 I think. So that is the program he's in right now. And how long has he been in that program? Nearly two years now. Great. And did Trevon's high school track or plans change since we last spoke? You mean high school? He's out of it. So his post high school has changed because he's not going to College of  anymore. So he's not getting any credit classes. These are all non-credit classes in transition program. So he was planning to do a certification program, which he's come to a stop now. Okay. And when he, when did he actually, oh, okay. Hold on. I'm sorry. Okay. So when is he planning on exiting the high school transition program? 22. When he turns 22 after two years. Okay. So what year would that be? Two more years. 2023? Yeah. Okay. And when is his birthday, around what month would that happen? February? He was born in February 2001. Okay. Great. And you mentioned he's not currently working? No. And what should I put, can you remind me one more time, sort of why he's not working? Because the school is not providing any of the employment program anymore. Thank you. They had a job coach and everything for him. Okay. And has he worked and left any jobs since we last spoke? He, I think we talked in January and at that time he was working in Home Depot and Whole Foods. And from March onwards they stopped it. Okay. And did he receive payment at either one of these jobs? Yeah, he was getting some payment. Okay. I'm just going to ask you a couple questions about those two jobs. Or just actually, yeah. So of those two, was there one that he held the longest during high school? He was in Whole Foods for a fairly long time. Okay. And how did he find that job? He used to like it, but in Home Depot, actually, they started to give him more risk responsibility. They asked him to do inventory labeling and putting things back on the shelf, scanning the items. So I think he's enjoyed that more. He started learning. In Whole Foods he was just bagging, I think. But in Home Depot they asked him to do more responsible work. Okay. So at Whole Foods he bags. Did he, but when you said he did inventory label and scanning, did he do that at Whole Foods as well? No, he was just bagging there. In Home Depot he started doing these other things and he was learning how to do it. Okay. And going back to the Whole Foods job, how did he find the job was open? Or how did he get that job? Everything through school. Okay. And about how many hours a week did he work at that job at Whole Foods, do you remember? I think it was a total of about two and a half hours. I think they worked there for about one and a half hours, and then there was a transportation, so maybe one and a half hours. And he used to go to two job sites. So that would be like about three hours of work. Okay. And do you remember sort of off the top of your head around what month and year he began working at the whole foods? I'm thinking about two years back. Two years back. So what year is this? So about 2019? Yeah. Okay. Do you remember the month by any chance? If you don't it's okay. I don't think I remember the month. Okay. And when did he stop working at the Whole Foods? March in 2020. Right when COVID hit. Okay. Yeah. And when he was working at the Whole Foods, did he receive support? Yes. He had a job coach. Did the job coach work one on one? I think he worked with a group. They were like three, four students who would go. Okay. Great. And now it's asking what was his reason for leaving again? It's because of COVID right? Yes. COVID yes. Okay. School stopped the program because of COVID. And do you think that this job was a good fit for Trevon's skills and interests at the Whole Foods? Yes. I'm sure they would've given him more challenging work as he went along. Okay. And then one more time, at the Home Depot he took inventory, scanned, and what was the last thing you said? Things that were like, he would show them after scanning the barcodes. Right. Okay. And did he get job support there as well? Yeah, similar system. The job coach would go with him. Okay, great. Did he volunteer or has he volunteered in the community since we last spoke? No. Okay. And is there anything else you would like to tell us or any other updates that you want to share that we didn't talk about today? No, not much has happened, so it was bad. Okay. I think I've shared most of it. Great. So the last thing...\n",
            "finish... Great. Next one, do you need a break before we move on to the vocational? No, I'm fine. Okay. All right, great. Let's talk about his experiences with work and/or volunteering. All right, so I guess I'm not a 100% sure, is Dylan still in high school? He's in his second year of transition. He's in a transition program? Mm-hmm . Did he work at all when he was in regular high school, before the transition program? He did. Like I said, going to the park district and wiping down the pop machines and tables, but yes, he was able to. He was able to. Were the jobs set up through the school? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay. Do you know how many jobs he had? Probably about four. . Okay. Did he get paid for any of them? He did. Okay. Was there one job in particular where he worked the longest, or was it a little bit here and a little bit there? He liked working, it was a retirement center. He would clean the rails and the doors. I think he really liked it a lot, because, as parents, you can have money come home or just have it stay at school. I just had it stay at school, so then they would take him to Five Below. I think he liked the ride to the retirement center, it was getting out a little bit. Was it on a bus, like a school bus? Mm-hmm . It was their transportation. I think they had vans. I'm guessing with different employees from the school? Mm-hmm . Okay. Do you remember, on average, how many hours a week he worked at that job? It just would depend on Dylan, because if there was behaviors that day or something, so no. So it varied. Okay. How did he find the job? Was it set up by the school or was it something separate? Yes. Okay. Great. Okay. Does he currently work there? No. No? Okay. Do you remember, if you can it'd be helpful, if you can't we'll just guess, about when he started working there month and year, approximately? Within the last year, definitely. Within the last year. Like the last school year? Oh wait. I'm talking about before he went to the transition program. I'm talking about once he's been in transition. Are you talking about high school? I'm talking about high school. Did he work during high school? It's okay, we can put it in a separate section. He did. Yes, he did. His jobs there, though, okay, so he had jobs, sometimes his job was just within the school, meaning you wash the forks or put the plates away in the kitchen. Okay. Okay. Okay. When you said four jobs, that was post high school or during school? It's the same school, so you mean transition versus non transition? Yeah. Yeah. We're separating the two, because- Got it. Did he get a certificate when he finished the first four years or did they just move him straight- He did. He had like a little graduation . Thinking about before that little graduation, how many jobs do you think, approximately? Maybe two. Okay. Great. Thank you. Did he get paid for those? I believe so. Okay. Great. Was there one where he worked the longest? Mm-mm . Were they mostly in this school or in the community? No. Both in the school and in the community. He was able to go in the community then, he was on, well, I thought good meds, but apparently not. It was just too much for him, but yeah. Okay. Great. And hours also varied? Mm-hmm . Okay. It wasn't anything long, if he'd go there for a half hour. Yeah. Okay. Just thinking about high school, was it through the whole four years? Do you know when they started, when he began working at these jobs? Oh goodness. He had to have been past 16. They're not going to work him at 14. Exactly. You're right. I didn't think about that. Let's just put around his 16th birthday. Sure. Sure. When would that be? May. May 2016, because he was born in 2000. That's easy. Okay. Then I'm going to put when he finished high school is when he stopped working, so would that be May, June? That's when he stopped working when- For the high school jobs. Thank you. Yes. Before transition. For transition, yeah, he started again. What year would that be? Transition, it's his second year in, so what- 2017. Yeah, 2018. 2018, 19, 19, 20. Yeah. I keep forgetting it's 2020. I know. Okay. So yes, part of school programming. Can you give me, one more time, I'm sorry, what he did in the schools? You mentioned the retirement center, but what kind of duties did he have in the school? For a job-wise? Mm-hmm . In the kitchen. He was putting dishes away or he was in charge of the silverware, maybe cleaning tables in the lunchroom. Thanks. Great. Did he receive support while working in the schools? You mean direction or monetary? Direct instruction, a job, any of those? Yes. Oh yeah. Okay. Can you describe job training? Was there a job coach? I'm not sure of the exact specifics of procedures, but he's always had someone with him and they direct him on where the silverware needs to go or redirect him if needed. Help him with breaks. Sometimes maybe he needs to take a break in between unloading a dishwasher. Okay. Great. Thank you. I'm just thinking of the kitchen job, that the job was a good fit for his skills and interests? I do. Can you tell me why? He liked being in the kitchen, and I think he liked engaging with the other students. Engaging, for him, it's just having others around him, so it's not the verbal conversation, but it's just being a part of. Great. Did he volunteer at all in the community during high school? Not that I'm aware of. Okay. Great. All right. Now we get to talk about after he started the transition program. Yes, the whole rest of the interview will just be about that; about any programs, academic programs, employment, or volunteering that he's done. Can we start off by just talking about what does a typical week look like for Dylan and how does he spend his time? During the day, during the afternoon, the evening, weekends? Yeah. During the week. No, we don't need the weekends, because really just focusing on the activities and programs he's in. Okay. He gets up at seven. He leaves the house by 7:35. He goes to school. The school is about 50 minutes away. Has a full day at school. School's out at 2:30. From 2:30, at that point, he basically gets on the bus again, within the next 20 minutes to head over to the Star Academy, Clearbrook, after school camp, and he's there from, I don't know, 3:00 till 4:30, the absolute latest. In fact, I originally had him there a half hour and they said to me, \"Donna, that's just not enough.\" Really what was happening, he would be drawing at the Star Academy, and he'd be drawing and doing his thing, and then the van was there for him and he was upset. He didn't want to leave. But I thought I was just introducing him to the program, because I just wanted him home. They asked, \"Well, what's happening is he's coloring and he's enjoying himself,\" and there are no expectations. Unlike school, there you just color and you get to watch the turtle swim in the tank and you get to eat snack. I left him there longer and so the van picks him up 4:15, 4:30, and then brings him home. He's home by 5:15, 5:30. When he's home, then he eats dinner, and just does his own thing. He loves being in his room. He has his favorites, Zoboomafoo, on the TV, or Elmo. But it's odd, it's like any other typical teenager, he likes his time in his room. He'll come in the kitchen and engage because he wants to eat. I do encourage him to come out in the family room, and sometimes he does, but he likes to be in his room. You have to respect that too. Sure. Sure. You do. We give him his meds about seven o'clock and by eight he's taking a bath, and by 8:15, 8:30 he's in bed. That's his typical day during the week. Okay. Are there any other activities he does during the week, aside from school and the Star Academy? No. No, it's too much. Okay. Oh, no problem. I just want to make sure we're not missing anything. I hate to say this, but not only is it too much, okay, he's not motivated. He's not going to go play soccer or be on a track team. I tried to do the swim team for him and no, it's not happening, and that's fine, but I do have twins who are 15, and so I hate to say this, but it helps me that he's not active because I'm there lugging them around here and there because they don't have their license yet. That's right. Okay. We did a little math now, during the typical week, about how many hours does he spend doing these activities? I can help you with this, so if he's at school till 2:30 and then ... Yeah. He has a long day from 7:30 to 5:30, at the latest, right? He does. Mm-hmm . That's a 10 hour day, five days a week, so I'm going to put 50. Okay. Great. He is currently enrolled in a transition program at his high school, and can you tell me the name of the school or program if they're separate? Kirk. K-I-R-K. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about the program? Like what do they do? Do they have classes? What kind of programs do they have in this school? It is a therapeutic day school. I don't know the stats, but a lot of the kids are on the spectrum. I don't even know the term to use, when kids are in wheelchairs, what is that? Is it ambulatory? Yeah. They do have kids who are there for that, but even if they are immobile, it's not just that that's their only disability or condition. There's other impairment going on, all the kids there, there's not one there that is typical. Okay. What's the general gist of the program? I know it's a transitional program, so do you know how they spend their days? Supposed to be, and not supposed to, they do, they do work with the students as far as helping them get out into the community more. The housing. As far as independent skills, they have, at the school itself, little kitchen areas set up like an apartment, if you will. I don't know a whole lot about that because right now, like I said, Dylan, we've been working with him, and just the school as well, more for the behaviors. A lot of it was Dylan's men changes, and that's been really ongoing for, oh my gosh, ever since he graduated high school. Okay. Sorry. I'm just trying to code this the right way. If you don't mind, give me a moment. Okay. Okay. Great. All right. When did Dylan start this program? Can you remember the month and year? It was two years ago, you said? The transition program? Yes. The transition program. Yes. He graduated high school in May of 2018, so he started in August of 2018. Okay. Great. Great. Okay. Now, vocational activities after, so we talked about the retirement center, so is he currently participating in that job? The retirements or any kind of employment? No, he's not able to right now, and it's the behaviors, and not that he's having them consistently, but even like, oh gosh, three weeks ago, when he was pounding excessively, he looked like the Elephant Man. I'm not going to send them anywhere like that. In fact, maybe three nights ago, he started again, but we immediately caught him, but still his eye is blue-black. Okay. Great. I mean, not great, but thank you for that information. I'm sorry that you're having to struggle through this and try to figure it out by keep changing. All right. Hopefully it'll get better. Yeah, and it has. It has. All right-\n",
            "finishVocational assessment, participant 2-0-0-7-1-7-20. We'll just put it here. Okay. And then he went to a church also sometimes. I think they did some little work in the church, cafeteria or something. And do you remember the name of the church? Calvary Church. And you just want to know about high school right now? I'll get to after high school. Has he had jobs after high school? Yes. Similar thing. They still... Okay. So let me do high school first. So do you work during high school? So that would say Caputo's, Whole Foods, the church, and Culver's, so that would be four places. Yeah. Did he receive payment at any of these jobs? Yes. He got some payment. Okay. Did he get paid at all four of those places? Yes. Okay. So let's talk about the one that he held onto the longest, one of the paid jobs that he worked at the longest. Is there one that stands out? Oh, I think he went to Whole Foods the longest. Okay. How did he find the job? He was okay. I think he quite enjoyed it. It's only for one hour. Okay. And in the beginning, the school said that slowly, he built his ability to work for longer period, his energy level. Okay. And his quality of work went up as he worked from the beginning to the end. They found an improvement in him and he was quite positive about the whole experience. He was happy to go. And was it one hour per what? Day? Per week? Twice a week. Oh, two times. And every time it was about an hour and there used to be about half an hour to go and come back. So I think totally it was about one and a half hours or so. Okay. And then how did he get this job? Did he find it through school or...? Yeah, it's a school program. They organize everything. And what's the name of the school? Neuqua Valley. N-E-U-Q-U-A. Okay. So you said about one and a half hours a week. Do you remember the month and year where he began working at the job? When he comes here, we can confirm it. I think it was 11th grade, second semester. Sorry, I think he refused to work in 11th grade. I think he worked all of 12th grade, yes. Okay. We'll confirm it when he comes. And he just finished 12th grade last year. So probably 2018 he started? Yeah. Okay. Should we put, he can confirm, but just for now, can I put the beginning of the school year then? Yeah. Okay. So 2018, 2019. Okay. And does he currently work there? He works in Whole Foods. And in the last semester he worked in Home Depot. So after high school, he does the STEPS program, which is a transition program of our school district. It's uppercase S-T-E-P-S. It's called STEPS. Okay. And they have a similar program. I think he still works one or one and a half hours twice a week. And in the last semester he went to Whole Foods and Home Depot. So, that would be the semester we just had. Okay. So, he's still working there. And I think in this semester they have changed it. I think is going to go to Home Depot and some healthplex. He hasn't yet gone. It's going to start. Okay. And at Whole Foods, you said he did some bagging? Correct. And in Home Depot he had to do inventory and checking items and things like that. Stacking, I think. And did he do any inventory or stacking at Whole Foods? I'll have to check that with him. I think most of the time he told me he's doing more of bagging there. Okay. And when he was working at Whole Foods, did he receive support? Yeah. There is a work coach with him. Okay. The whole time? I think so. Someone comes from the school with them. Great. And then would the school take him to and from the job? Yes. Or did he take public transportation? No. The school takes him. Do you think this job was a good fit for  skills and interests? It was something new he learned. And it was his first experience at working in a workplace, learning thing. So definitely it helped him behavior-wise and what is expected. It taught him how to write a resume, do some job interviews and things like that. So I think it was a good experience for him. Okay. Just want to make sure I get enough information. Do you remember when he worked at Whole Foods, what his job title was? Was it bagger? Was it...? I think it was bagger. Assistant or...? Okay. They don't really share in written with us. It's just based off what he tells me. Oh, okay. Alright. I can ask him too. Great. So did he volunteer in the community during high school? Not really, no. Okay. Okay. Alright. So now after...the rest of the interview is going to look at academic programs, employment and volunteering after high school. So first, just to get an idea of how he spends his time, I want to just talk a little bit about what he participates in during a typical week. So for , what does a typical week look like and how does he spend his time? He goes to the STEPS program. So that is from five days a week in the last semester. I'm trying to take him to a local community college, but because he has his social ties, this particular school program is in the same building where he had his high school. Okay. And all his peers whom he knew many, like the special need kids go over there. So he is very unwilling to completely come out of that system. So I'm slowly trying to move him to College of DuPag. So he was quite hesitant, but I've been taking him to evening classes. So all through the day he goes there from the morning. I think the school starts at 7:45 and ends at 1:45. And then twice a week, I was taking him to College of Dupag in the evening. So in the evening he was attending class from 6:00 to 8:50. Okay. Twice a week. Okay. And then, what about any... So then also you said he also he does work? The work is a part of the STEPS program. So is that during that morning program between, what was the times again? Twice a week they go. I think they go Tuesdays and Thursdays. About one and a half or two hours they go out. So, great. So, what are some of the activities that he's currently involved in? So we have postsecondary education program. So that would be the College of DuPag, correct? And even in STEPS, there is an educational as part of it. They have classes where they do training for transportation. They're learning how to get into a bus. And they go by train, the teachers take them. They're slowly teaching them how to become independent. Then they learn how to do resumes. So they have an employment thing. They have some math. Which is more like they're trying to teach them daily living skills, how to budget and things like that. And they also help them with vocational training and helping them with the jobs. Yeah, writing with the resumes and everything. How about, is he involved at all in an adult day program or sheltered workshop? No. Okay. And then he works for pay, but with job support, correct? Yes. Okay. And you said he doesn't do--post high school, has he done any volunteering? No. Okay. Okay. So how many hours total during the average week does he spend participating in all of these vocational and educational activities? School is from 7:45 to 1:45. So what would that be? Six hours a day. Six hours a day and twice a week, he was going to... We can say three hours. So six hours total in College of Dupag and that is going to increase in the second semester. I put him in two, but now he's not going to go on Tuesdays and Thursdays to STEPS. He will go to College of DuPag. Okay. So I have that it's 30 hours a day currently in the STEPS program, you said it's twice a week at the College of DuPag. So is that six hours total then? Total. That he's there. So, that would be 36 hours. That was the last semester and now it's going to change. He'll not go to STEPS on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Instead, he will go to College of DuPag from 9:00 to... I think about six hours plus two. So eight hours in College of DuPag. So you can subtract 12 from the last one and add eight. Total. So it'll be 18 plus... 24 plus eight, 32 hours then. Okay. Thank you. I have to do a little math. I bet you didn't know you'd have to do a little math today. Okay. So now we're going to talk a little bit about the school programs that he's attended after high school. So the STEPS program. So, yes. So the name of the most recent one is STEPS. STEPS with an S, correct? Yes. All are uppercase. It stands for something student, postsecondary something, something. If you want, I think  Come on in. ... That is a part of a certification program for animation. So he took drawing one and in semester two, he's going to take drawing two and he's going to take a class on interpersonal skills. So two classes. Okay. And from Steps, they have a special Olympics. So you can choose the sport you want to do. He didn't do soccer in the... They have different options. So he's doing basketball right now. So that means- Through Steps or through the community college. Through Steps. Through Steps. Okay. And he goes, I think twice a week, they have practice for about an hour each. So about two hours of practice and then they have matches sometimes. Okay. All right. So overall, you can say maybe three hours a week of special Olympics. How many hours is he adding on? Did you say one more time to the semester at the college of DuPag? Eight. Six hours of drawing and two hours of interpersonal skills or one and a half. One and a half. And he started there. Was it just this fall? Was it in August or? Yeah. Okay. And in the college DuPag, does he receive supports? They have some kind of support in the sense he has to take a card or something, which says that he's a SpecialEd student. But it's not like high school. There's no aid or anyone. Okay. Does the card have any accommodation or modifications on it? At least in drawing, there's not much. But if he was in a science class or something, they would allow him a recorder to record. He's not using any of those yet? Yes. Okay. But if he needed it, the card ensures that he gets it. Okay. Yeah. This is 504 accommodations, so the card gives him... Okay. Are there any additional comments that you have about this academic program that you want me to add in here? Just for us to get the bigger picture about  experience at the college of Dupag? I think that is about it. Okay. This goes too fast. Okay. Now we're going to just talk about vocational, after high school. We talked about Home Depot. So let me just get that in here. So he's at Whole Foods and Home Depot, right? I'll just check again. Sure, then. In the second semester. You're going to some Healthplex and? Home Depot. And home Depot. So no more Whole Foods? Whole Foods is out now. Yeah. So Home Depot. And what was the other one you just said? It's a Healthplex. I'm not sure where exactly. That's what they had just written. Some new place. He has not yet gone there. Okay. So we'll focus on Home Depot then. So you said he does inventory at Home Depot. Shavan? Yeah. What exactly is the work that you do in Home Depot? Returning stock. Returning the stocks. You put it back in the place where it belongs? Yeah. Okay. Do you have to match it to some paper or something? Yeah. There's an app. There's an app that he has to match things that have been returned. He has to stock them back. Okay. All right. Anything else? Is that all you do in Home Depot? Mm-hmm . Okay. If you can think of something else tell me. It's okay. Because I'm going to ask him some of these questions too to complete this. Restocking. Great. Does he receive supports in this job? Shavan there's a teacher with you at all times, or does he come sometimes and stand with you? At all times. They let us work on our own. Okay. I think he's just watching, the teacher, if he makes a mistake or something, then they'll fix it. Okay. And they're from the Steps program? Yes. Make sure to clarify that. Great. And is he paid? Yes. Great. They get paid some $5 or $6 an hour, I think. And how did he find this job? They're all through Steps. I think they interview and they see their skill levels, and try to match them with the jobs. Great. And how many hours per week for this one did we say? About- I think so. I'll check with the him once. Shavan? Yeah. How many hours are you there? From what time to what time are you in Home Depot? Two hours. Two hours in a week or two hours at one time. Two hours. Tell me at the time you- 8:30 to 10:30. 8:30 to 10:30? Mm-hmm . So that means four hours? No. Yeah. Something like that. So two hours on Tuesday and two hours on Thursday? Now, it's going to be two hours Monday, two hours, Friday. Okay. So four hours. Four hours. So I think it has increased in Steps. And when did he start this Home Depot job? Home Depot? He did in the first semester. So August, 2019. Okay. Great. Okay. Do you have any other comments about the job program that you want to add? I think that's about what I know about his work. And has he participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since leaving high school that we didn't talk about? No. Okay, great. We are done with that one. I just need to ask him some questions from it. But I'll do that when I have him come in later. Okay.\n",
            "finish... For the service access interview. Next up, I'm going to ask you about the vocational activity index, the third part of our interview. Give me one moment. Last time we spoke, at least you with us, we discussed activities that Michael had been involved in, and now we'd like to hear how he's doing now. First off, just to confirm, Michael is still in the transitional program for his high school? Yes, sir. Sorry. Do you hear me? Right. Yes. Okay. Yes. Now I could. Yes, he's still in transition. Going to ask you some question about his employment. Is Michael currently working? No. Okay. For why he's not currently working, would you say it's mainly due to the whole COVID situation or something else that's happening? No, because he's still in school and I'll start looking for all this stuff next year when he gets out of school. Okay. He has not worked or left any job since the last time that we spoke, right? Nope. Okay. Has Michael volunteered in the community during high school, since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. All right. That's it for the vocation activity. Next, I'm going to move on the final part of our interview here, which is the Goal Attainment Scale or the GAS Attainment Scoring, so if you remember the last time we did a followup interview with you, there was some goals that were created to help your son Michael, and the purpose of the goal development was to support the families in helping them pursue their dreams in the future and really start working on these goals. Since about a year has passed now, we just like to know how they're doing with these goals, and before we continue to discuss his progress, we feel it is important to say that we understand that a lot can happen in a year and that the past year was especially unpredictable. We also understand that COVID might have imposed barriers to completing certain goals. Now I'm going to go through the three goals that were chosen and I'll remind you about each of them. The first one was within a year, your son will independently take breaks and count to 10 three out four times he is stressed and the focus was on how independently he's able to take the break, not needing any prompts from an adult. Over the last year, how would you say he has been doing with this goal? I guess fine. He doesn't get too stressed out lately where he needs to take breaks. I guess more in detail, has him be able to independently take a break? I know you mentioned he does not get stressed out that much lately, but if there was any moment that you remember that he has, was he able to independently take a break and do the strategy of counting to 10? I don't think he really counts to 10. It's more, if he wants a break, he just goes in his room, closes the door and just takes a break by himself. It might be different for him at school, if he's upset for something at school, but at home, you know? All right. Moving on to the second goals, the second goal was by the end of the year your son would be able to explore four career possibilities with adult support. For example, looks at local openings, researches job duties, focusing on the number of career possibilities he researched on. No, we have not done any of that. I believed when I signed up for this, I figured, and I think I told him once he gets out of school, we would start looking. For him, he wants to work at McDonald's and clean tables, which hopefully, coming up in the next school year, they could start getting back out into the community and explore some of these things. Got it. Okay. Basically, when this was all started, you guys thought a goal like this would be worked on maybe after he exited high school and really have the choices possible, does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking next January I can call that work program thing and start seeing how long the wait list is and start looking at all their stuff, because he wasn't going to be doing it while he was in school anyway. Or if they did go back to work at McDonald's, maybe he might get hired there for a couple hours a week or something. Yeah. It still was put on hold because of COVID and because, yes, I'm looking that into next January to start researching what we're going to do. Got it. Give me one moment. Yeah. Plus we might be moving to Florida too, so that could be a whole different ballgame once we move. Would you say that COVID also impacted the aspect of trying to work on this, go at all too as well? Right, because they would go in the community and they would work at a couple restaurants and McDonald's and go to the banquet hall and do stuff where all their stuff is done. Okay. Yeah. Makes sense. Okay. For the final goal, it was within a year, your son and your family would research a trust and meet up with a lawyer and complete all necessary paperwork to set up a trust, focusing on following such for. Yeah. We did all that stuff. Okay. Yeah. That makes sense, because as I was asking you the service access questions before you mentioned that he has both the trust and the ABLE account now, so you guys were able to complete this together. Just to get some more additional details, so you guys researched the trust, met with a lawyer, completed all the necessary paperwork to set it up, and do you guys also add funds to the trust as well? I didn't put no funds in there yet. Okay. Got it. The trust is beneficiary on my stuff. Okay. The ABLE account, I use any of his overage for his social security money. Got it. Just for final closing question, is there anything else you would like to tell us or any other updates you want to share about Michael? No, not really. Okay. Okay. I want to thank you so much for taking the time with us today with this. As a reminder, we'll be sending an online survey for you to complete, and there's also a portion of this interview, so after this section here, I'm going to ask what you mentioned earlier, do the interview with Michael. He is available to participate, right? After this, now, right? Is that correct? Yeah, that's fine. Like I said, I don't know how much information you're going to get out of him because he is more of a yes and no person. He's not going to be able to give you any kind of explanations on anything, and a lot of times he just says yes, to agree with things. What about? That survey thing that you got to do. Okay. Before we move to him, just like to-\n",
            "finishHe's not in high school now? No. Do you mind telling me what day he exit high school system? March 17, 2020. Do you mind telling me what does a typical week look like for Geo? Like how has he been spending his time? Okay. Yeah, sure. On Mondays, I'm going to talk to you first about outings we do. So on Mondays we visit grandma. And so we go there and have lunch, take a ride there and he sees her and that's our Monday. And then Tuesdays, we go to a sensory gym, which is mostly for younger kids, but the gym is actually a really nice indoor facility. And, there's an area where they can run a little, there're indoor swings. I feel like they get that sensory input there, that we do on Tuesdays. On Wednesdays, I take them swimming. So they go swimming at a college. It's lessons, but there's not many lessons learned. They just enjoy the pool. I mean, they do a lot of floating and stuff like that, but still. And then Thursdays, we visit another mom that has a son with autism, which I say they're friends and we go there on Thursday or Friday, just kind of depends. Then the other day is, they're home. Sometimes we've done it where we go to a church and we help with shredding items or doing some stuff like that. That seems to have helped deal a little bit. Obviously if the weather cooperates, we'll go to the park. We do community, we go to the store and buy items to make either cookies or pancakes or something like that. And then we'll visit grandma again one day out of the weekend, whether that's Saturday or Sunday just kind of depends. Geo loves going for walks. So we go to walks if we could, every day. But if the weather doesn't help, then you know, at least once or twice a week, unless it's under 35, I try to take him. Cause he doesn't really care how the weather is. He likes to walk, he likes to run. So we go together and he really, really enjoys it. Yeah. And then, the rest of the time of the day, we're basically picking up and trying to work on daily life stuff. Okay, thank you. So now Geo is not involved in vocational training program or any activity? No. So do you mind telling me how many total hours during the average week does Geo spend participating in all of this vocational educational activities? I don't know. Maybe 20? 20 hours a week? Yeah. I would say, maybe more, but I don't know. It's kind of hard to pinpoint every item, but yeah. So is this vocational or educational activity mostly provided by you or- Yes. Is Geo currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in academic program at vocational school or a community college? No. So I'm just trying to confirm with you is that Geo has not been involved in any academic program after high school? No. Am I correct? Okay. Yeah. So is Geo currently participating in any employment, vocational, or volunteering activites? Say that again? Is he currently participating in any employment, vocational, or volunteering activities? I mean, he does volunteer with me at the church, but that is not for me to see, or any of that, he does it with me. I organize it for him. Okay. Thanks. We go for the last session.\n",
            "finishOkay, this is part two. Participant 2014 and it's working. Okay, great. So we're going to start by talking about employment and volunteering activities that Louis has been involved in during high school. So at this point, is he still in high school? He had the graduation ceremony, but he still have those two years until he's 22. So he's in that period of time. He's in the transition. Please and remember, whatever I say it is from a person that comes from a different country and your school system is very rich, and complete, and different than my experience. Do the best that you can, that's all we ask. Yes, of course. Exactly. Okay. So while he was still in the high school part of the program. While he was in high school, did he work? He volunteered at the end, I think his last two years. In a summer program. Okay. Do you remember what it was called? I can answer you if I call my wife right now, she's at home. Real quick. Before you do that, did he work at a job at all when he was in high school? Not now. No. A job where he would receive a salary, a formal salary. He had not done that. But he did volunteer. He volunteered and he received a salary. It was $8 an hour. So yeah, he did that. He did at the art program? In the art program, yes. That was a program? No, that's true. That he work on that one. Yeah. In my mind, that's not a job. Right. I'm sorry. I come from a different experience of life, you know that? It's okay. I would pay for do that. I would not be receiving a salary. Sure. Yeah, it was a program. So it was a summer job? Yeah. And it was the city that was doing a mosaic. Okay. So there was a grant for the artist, and the artist need to hire students with vocational art and kids that having special challenges to the project. So he was working with an artist doing a mural? Exactly. And he's good. He's a very artistic guy. And he like it and he was happy with that. Okay. Yeah. And now he works. He volunteers an overtime, not works because he didn't want a new salary. Hold your thought. I'm going to ask you about where he works now in just a minute. If you don't mind, I want to just finish this part because then I'll get to that. When he worked at the art program, sorry to interrupt you by the way, how many hours a week do you remember did he work? You can take a guess. Let's say four days a week. Five hours each evening. Okay. So 20? 20 hours maybe? Yeah. Okay. And that was the last two summers? The last two summers. So 2019 and 2018? Okay, great. So that means he probably began in June, right? Of 2018? And does he currently work there? Will he be working there this summer? No, he is not. He had not applied, . I don't know if that is possible, I will check on that. Okay. So then he . Sorry, I have to put dates in here. Okay. And did he get this job as part of school programming? Like through Oak Park or Forest High School? Exactly. Okay. One second. I mean that program there were kids with all levels of development. It sounds fun. Yeah. I wish I could have participated something like that. I was mentioning to you, it would be a relaxing thing. The first thing that I would do when I retire would be something like that. I would apply. Nice. Help him. A muralist. Yeah. While he was doing this particular summer job, did he receive any support? From a job coach or an adult who came in through the school to give him instructions? The artist make an evaluation for all those who participate. And she knew that Louis had the biggest challenges. So, they find a specific area where he could perform. That's great. Okay. Do you think this job was a good fit for his skills and interests? Louis is an artistic guy. I think he was happy and excited. I think each time that the door opens, he smiles. But he need to find the  door and not an enemy. That's the problem. Each time that he sees a door, he thinks that it's an enemy. And I'm trying to convince him, \"No, it's not.\" Alright. So during high school, besides this, did he volunteer at all in the community? Not getting paid during high school? No, that was probably his first job. Okay. Alright. So now for the rest of this interview, now we're going to focus on now. Something that I would like to mention is, for reasons of work, I moved from Michigan, Grand Rapids, to here. And I think that was a big challenge for the whole family, and for him as well. So I think that has been a challenge for his interaction as well because his whole world changed. Okay. Absolutely. Probably he could have done more jobs. But when you move from one place to another one, I need to focus on bringing the bread, not looking for fun activity. That was not my goal when I moved. No one's judging you. I know. What I'm what I'm trying to say is, this is not Louis' fault. Right. If there's a fault, it would be mine, but that was  other thing. It's reality. Yeah. That what it is. Alright. Well, thinking about how things are now. So, what I'd like you to do is just think a bit, a minute, and I don't mean socially. But I want to talk about the way Louis spends his week. So can you give me a little bit of an idea of what's a typical week for Louis look like? When does he go to this transition program? And does he work? Louis wake up for himself. Once in a while he will not, but most of the time he is awake by himself around six in the morning. Okay. And he's very concerned on the bus that is coming to pick him up, a school bus. Then he goes to his training, he goes five times a week. Okay. Until 2:00 PM, I feel like that. 2:30 maybe, sometimes it's 3:00. Each day is different to be sincere. So sometimes it's 3:00 PM. Let's put 3:00 as an average. Then I let him cool down for an hour, hour and a half. And then will become the battle. Need to help at home. He doesn't like to help at home, but his responsibilities that he has not assumed fully yet. Some weeks, yes. But most of the time, not there yet. Take out the garbage, take out the table, put the dishes away. Okay. When he put his own energy, he does very well. But, the day that he would put the dishes where it don't belong. When he doesn't want to do stuff, he let you know by not performing properly. Does he spend time during the week at all when he's not doing that or going to school working? Does he have a job right now or volunteering anywhere? No. This training have a volunteer component. Okay. So through the school? Through the school. One of these days a week. If I not wrong, it's Wednesday. Right now we need to take him to the hospital. Okay. He work in the hospital, clean the chapel. Okay. Rush you said right? The one here in Harlem and close to the highway. Okay. So he's in a transition program, which includes vocation. Does he get any money for the work that he does through the school? No. Okay. So how many hours a week, do you think, does he work cleaning the chapels and doing some of the work. So he's 20 hours at school, but within that? Probably Louis can answer you that better than me. I'll ask him. Or I can ask Mary later if you want. That's fine. Maybe six hours in total, but I will suggest Louis can give you better answer. I'm telling you, I need to find him to know what happens during the week. I know because I read the paper, but not because he tell me. Right. Okay. Great. Alright. So is Louis currently enrolled or has he been enrolled ever in an academic program at like a community college? A vocational school? Not yet. If you tell me that, that would be a goal for instance, but I don't know if he's capable for that. A primary goal for me will be to find whatever he wants to do. Right. I have tried to convince him from many areas. He likes biology a lot. I always tell him, \"Work on the food.\" No, he doesn't want because I said it. So, I don't want to say no more. Sure. Maybe a lobotomist. That would be a good profession. Right. I think he can do it, but I have not even say a word, because if I say a word, I know there will be a no. Right. So that my concern. Lobotomist can pay his bills and it's not that rocket science, so that's fine. I think that would be good. Okay. So that's something for the future. Again, what part of the program, why you want to do this program? Right? Exactly. So he can get on a career course and go to program. Okay. If nothing is accomplished, and he finish in a school at the end of his program, I will be in peace. Great. Well, and you're going to learn so much from this experience that you'll have so many more options to present, or you and your wife will. Okay. Back to his job that he does right now at the hospital, you don't know the name of the hospital, do you, by any chance? Harlem and where is it? Harlem close to the 290 lake. I can tell you right now because I need to take him there. Only know Loretto. I need to take him there, so Mary send me the email. Give me one second, and I tell you in a second. No problem. Rush. Ah, okay. Thank you. Alright. And so you mentioned that he cleans the chapel. Is there anything else he does? As far as I know, he take care of the floors, cleaning, that kind of things. Now, as I mentioned it to you, I'm not the person who ask this because he doesn't talk to me and I know because I hear what he tells with his mom or to his sister. That's fine. Well, I'll ask you one more question and if you don't know, we can ask him. Yeah. When he is working at this job, does he have people who are supporting him? Either a job coach from the school? Somebody from the school close with him? I don't know. Okay. I don't know. What I know is that he has improved a lot. That he can manage himself on that kind of things. And he's smart, he can do a lot of things. He pays attention because he's very distracted. Okay. Does he get himself there when he's not here with us? No. Everything is the bus. School bus come pick him up and take him wherever he needs to go. It is my understanding, I'm not sure if that has happened, but when we were setting the goals at the beginning of the year that they were going to be going together as a group, as I was mentioning to you in the bus. Okay. In a bus, in the public transportation, even he have a public transportation card. But he doesn't like to use it, but he doesn't go nowhere. Well, that's something you hopefully will work on this year, right? Exactly. How did he find this job? Program. Through the school program? Okay. I just want to make sure, that's what I typed. There's no motivation for him yet, on that. And we're saying about four to six hours a week, right? Mm-hmm . Okay. And did he start at the beginning of this school year? No. Early in the summer. Okay. Around what month do you know? I think it's July. They give him only one month of vacation. Okay. And then was I parish that was even a shorter amount of hours, but it was to test the program to see if he feels like he want to be there or not, because there was not something required for him. So he decided to go for it, yes. So he tested the program in the summer to see if it was a good fit and decided to go ahead. He decided to go. Great. Has he participated in any other employment, vocational, or volunteering since leaving high school? So just since he left. No. I thought about it and I talked to his sister three, four years ago when she was working in a fast food restaurant. Yeah. College thing that you do. Yeah. And she was telling me no, that my brother's not ready for managing and that kind of thing yet. And I trust her, she's a very wise girl. I think if somebody knows him well, it's his mom and his sister. That's great. I follow her advice. You learn from everyone, right? Stop this.\n",
            "finishSo half of sophomore year two, wait... Two jobs, Sophomore year. Okay. One job, junior year. So he's on his 3rd place of employment. Okay. Because they switch every quarter, every semester. Okay. And has he received payment for any of the jobs? Yeah, they have a small stipend. It's not minimum wage, if anything, it's just a small stipend. So he gets a paycheck. Yeah. So, that he gets experiences... Yes. Of getting a paycheck. Right? So of those three jobs, is there one in particular or where does he, has he worked at one longer than the other or are they all kind of about the same amount of time? They are all one semester at school. Okay. He just started his one for this year or this semester, which is, he works at Walgreens, doing expiration date, pulling and product facing and stuff like that. So that one, I don't... He's only gone there maybe once so far. He'll go tomorrow, because tomorrow might be his 3rd time he goes, I think. Okay. I forgot the calendar, so that one's very new. He did a semester at project Habitat for Humanity Restore. And then he did a semester at the public library. Okay. Now the public library was the one that I would say he's had the most time in because he went to the public library as his job twice a week. But also prior that we had volunteered at the library. So if you add those together, he's been in the library more than anything. Okay. So let's talk more about that particular job then. Can you kind of give me an overview of what he did at the library When he was volunteering on his own, when I would just take him over the summer, he was dusting and straightening bookshelves. So in the stacks he would dust the books and then he would make sure they were all pushed against the edge of the shelf. Okay. And he would do it an hour and then he would... Very tedious work. So an hour is probably enough for most people. Yeah. So he'd worked for an hour and then that was it. When he went with school, he went with a job coach and they did a little bit more. So there was some of that and there was also alphabetizing and putting away DVDs. So our library has broken into genres of the DVDs and then within the genres, they're alphabetized by title. Okay. So he would do that. Okay. And from what I could, the reports I got from his job coach, he was pretty hands off. The job coach sat in a chair and observed from a distance. Okay. Once, he learned the task. So he faded away pretty quickly? Yeah. Great. All right. And when he was doing that job with school, after he had already volunteered over the summer, was he just doing the alphabetizing or was that kind of something that added on top of the dusting and facing the books outward outcome? I guess that's the right way to say it... Yeah. Facing them the right way. So I don't know exactly how that evolved. Okay. But I think they may not have known because it's a very large library. So we were volunteering through the team department. Okay. And he was, his vocational studies is through the community outreach department. Okay. ... I think, they call themselves. So it's possible that those two entities didn't even know that he had been a volunteer in different departments. Okay. So, that's just funny. Is it the Elgin Public Library? Yeah. It's called the Gail Borden Public Library. Could you spell that for me? Sure. Gail, G-a-i-l first name and then Borden, B-o-r-d-e-n. Just like I would think. Okay. The milk guy... So the first, so the job you got, I'm guessing through the school program. Mm-hmm . Okay, great. And during the school year, not of volunteering, volunteering, you said one hour a week. How many hours a week on average was it when he was doing it through school? They are, they go twice a week for a two hour block of time. That includes their commute to, it is just in town. Okay. So I would say they're probably more like an hour and a half of actual work twice a week. So three hours total a week. Great. Yeah. Okay. And when, what month and year did he begin working at this job? The library one? The library one, yes. So we did that one.... So probably, how do semesters go? To think about that... August would be... It would be the first part of the school year. Yeah, So August us through December. Okay. Yeah. And that would be 2018, 2017? No, this would be just this last school... Oh, okay. This school year. Oh okay. So 2019? Yeah. Oh yeah. I forgot a whole job he had, because the store went out of business. So he actually worked his entire sophomore year. Yeah, I forgot a job. He worked at Steak 'n Shake. Okay. He wiped tables, cleaned. He did cleaning at Stake 'n Shake. For a whole year? No, For a semester. Oh that's a semester ? First semester sophomore year, Steak 'n Shake. Second semester sophomore year, Habitat Humanity. First semester of junior year, Gail Borden library. Okay. Second semester of junior year, right now. Walgreens. Got it. Okay. I forgot about Steak 'n Shake. They went out of business and they keep them busy. Yeah. Oh yeah, okay. So  at school. Okay. So he's not at the library now though... Correct. Okay. So he stopped in December? Yes. When the school broke for the semester. Great. Okay. So I added the Steak 'n Shake. You said he does receive support, so yeah. Okay. Just kind of adding what you said to me in different places. Okay. So thinking about the library, do you think it was a good fit for his skills and interests? Yeah, I do. He likes being in the public sphere. Mm-hmm . He likes a predictable task and he likes the place that he feels comfortable and we of course visit the library all the time. So he felt very comfortable there. Yeah. Great, Okay. And then you mentioned that he volunteered there as well. I'm going to ask you a few questions about just the dates and things. You already tell me what he does. Was there anywhere else that he volunteered besides Gail Borden during high school? We go to the Northern Illinois Food Bank. Okay. Probably two or three times a year. They have an open... You can drop in and volunteer there and there's warehouse work. So we've done that. I don't know if he's... Nothing else really structured, I mean he follows me around town. Yeah. Because I do things and he helps me as I do things. Yeah. I work for a nonprofit, so I mean, he's been, he's helped me move tables and stuff, but not in a structured way. Okay. So I'm going to put helping mom. Yeah. Oh, and then, oh, forgot. So you know how high schools will have the indoor and outdoor concession stand? Yeah. So he and I would go and volunteer at the indoor, primarily the indoor concession stand at his sister's high school. Okay. Just because it was easier than his high school. So they go to separate high schools. Okay. His twin sister. So we would go and we'd run the concession stand during wrestling matches and such. And he would, I'd take the money and he'd fill the orders for... He'd make pretzels and he'd get sodas and stuff like that. Oh Cool. He enjoyed that... The concession stand, I forgot about that. That's volunteer work too. All right. So we've got great. So he worked Gail Borden. Mm-hmm . He's also worked at the food bank. Mm-hmm . Helping you around town and then at the high school concession stands. Yeah. And then of course for Steak 'n Shake and all that... And the Steak 'n Shake. Yep. ReStore. Yeah. For some reason for, yeah. I have all that information. Let me just make sure I got everything. Yeah. Great. That's it for this form. Thank you. Okay. Yeah. Just put complete... Christina, because Jack is still in high school. You will not have to ask him. I don't believe there's any parts of this particular one that he needs to fill out. Okay. So we are good. Great. Oh, that was easy. Now let's look at services. Okay. So for this part...\n",
            "finish... Second to last one. Okay. He was working at habitat for humanity resources. And he was to do ... They did cleaning, pricing, stocking on the store floor. There was one volunteer there that kind of was trying to help him on the register, which wasn't very successful and to make popcorn. And he did that for two semesters instead of just one. Okay, great. Okay. And did he find the job through high school programming then? Yes. We had a bit of an issue with their transition program because we, they pick basically they picked the internships for him based on who they had relationships with instead of what Josh's interests were. Okay. So, I mean, he had been wanting to do something with Culver's for quite some time. And we asked specifically for a placement at Culver's because we knew they hired individuals with disabilities. And they said that they don't have a relationship with them, so we couldn't go. Oh, okay. So it was basically like they would place kids wherever they had some sort of a connection with a business. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And it didn't matter if it was something that they liked or not. Okay. Oh. Well, how many hours a week would you say he worked at the habitat for humanity resource store? Is it a store? Would I call it a store? Yeah. There's a retail store where they saw like a repurposed home furnishings and stuff like that. He was there for four hours a week. Okay. And can you remember about when he began this job? He is been out of school since ... Okay. So it's 2020 now. So in October he'll be out for a year. So this would've been like December to May of 2019. Okay. Okay. So starting in December, maybe of 2018 going to May of 2019? Right. Yeah. That last semester? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, great. And did he receive support, like job coaching, things like that while he was working the internship? There was the job coach there. Okay. From the transition program, I'm guessing? Yes. In the transition program. Okay. And so you mentioned that it wasn't necessarily within his interest area, but do you think it was a good fit for him or not a good fit for him? It was a good fit, actually. It was one of his most successful internships. And now that we're looking towards competitive employment, it's one of the places that we've contacted to see if they hire him on. Oh, good. Okay. Okay. And did he volunteer at all in the community during high school? He volunteered at an animal shelter, helping paws out here in Woodstock. Okay, Great. Then the rest of this interview, we're just going to focus on what Josh has done after high school. So this part's kind of tough because COVID happened. So I think what I'm going to ask is let's talk about how his time is spent post high school before COVID, because everything's so different now. So thinking about how he spent his time with academic programs, employment, volunteering, sort of like, what did a typical week look like for him after high school? A typical week he would have ... Well during the season, he would have special Olympics practice three times a week. He was doing bowling and power lifting. He attended a NISRA program that's at special arc association once a week. It was a  rehab. But unfortunately that didn't happen until after... So right before COVID. So there's been nothing on that front right now, other than we got the evaluation done and he's been approved, but there's been no act on that. And then we tried ... Well, previous to me I had three children, or four children that drove and would try and take him to do things, going out to his Door or something to get away from us. Now that there's the three, they're still trying to do that as much as they can, but things are really hard. But they would take them out to go to the grocery store or to go bowling, just something to be doing an activity without us. Yep. Yep. Okay. So he's a pretty busy guy before all this happened. Yes, he was very busy. How many hours a week would you say does he or did he spend working with his dad in the landscaping in the mornings? It would be about between two or three hours. So his dad would take him out in the morning and then bring him back at lunchtime. Because for some of the bigger lawns that they have, then Josh would just be sitting in the truck. Got it, got it. Okay. And did you guys pay Josh for the work or did he just sort of work with him? He just started working. We didn't pay him. We were looking into how that works. But since my husband, he's the owner operator, so it's just him. We don't have any other employees to bring Josh on and pay him and pay into this. So it brings us into a whole different ... We have to reestablish the EIN number and then we have to do the quarterly taxes and everything else. And with just having the business as small as it is, it wasn't fiscally in our range to do that. So that's why we were looking for ... Because we do want Josh to pay into the system and to get paychecks and everything. That's why we looked for outside employment. Okay, great. And how about the math and literacy tutoring through GiGi's Playhouse. How many hours a week was that program? It's a half hour for each. So half hour for literacy and a half hour for math. Okay. All right. And then just off topic, not off topic, but does GiGi's Playhouse have ... So I know where they are in the city because I live right by there. Do you have to come all the way here to go to that? Or do they have other places around the suburbs? They have a lot of them all over. They're actually international and throughout the states. So I started ... Okay, so well maybe 16 years ago, the one in Hoffman Estates opened up and it was just like in a tiny little strip mall. And my parent support group that I was going to were meeting at the Palatine Library switched over to GiGi's. So that's how I got involved with it because my children have special needs, but none of them had down syndrome. So I had just gotten connected through there then yeah, the one in Chicago opened and then there's one out here in McHenry, and they moved around a little bit. But yeah, they've been opening up all, all over place. So thankfully didn't have to drive into the city, but I'm familiar with GiGi's. I know Josh has autism, not down syndrome, but let's see if they would consider having Josh go. So right now the only thing that they told us Josh could participate in was their speech and language. Because the grant that pays for that is specific to the down syndrome population. Okay. Oh, that's interesting. Huh. Okay. And the GiGi's, I didn't know they were everywhere like that and I like that they're inclusive. And I also didn't know they had so many different programs. In my limited understanding, I thought that the one over by me in the city was like the only one. I'm really wrong. Yeah. And each, because we go to the one in the McHenry, but the one in Hoffman Estates moved. They're still in Hoffman, but they created GGU, so a big university type thing where they do job training and types of programs and Josh can't go to that one because that's specifically for down syndrome. And I'm in the human service field. So I end up talking to people about different resources. And when I refer people over to them, I'm like always call the site manager at that location because some of them are more accommodating to people with other disabilities than others. That's so great. Oh, that's great that you know that information and you can pass it on. Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you. So he's going there once a week for an hour, half an hour on each, and he's working with dad. I think that's all I need to ask you for this part. When did he start working with his dad in the landscaping business? Basically for about the last 10 years. So when Josh was about 12 or 13, we would help out on job sites. If he cut down a tree, he would pick it up. And that's when Josh was able to follow directions a little bit better. And there wasn't as big of a safety concern with him darting out into the street. So we would basically go as a family to the different job sites for a while. He started going with Joe specifically, I'm trying to think, about five years ago, we chose to stop ESY, it's the summer school. Because what we found ... It was right after he graduated high school. So after that, they still offered him ESY. But we had him go the first week and what they were doing was basically coloring pictures and playing out on the play equipment. I mean, and that was it. There wasn't anything else that was going on. And we're like, okay, this is dumb. So we pulled him out and then Joe started taking him to work with them because I was working where I couldn't be home during the day. So it was kind of a care issue. And then the next summer he would go to ... We did  day camp and he was doing that for a while. And those were pretty much full days except Fridays. So then the last few summers, he would just go on a Friday with Joe and then this summer ... Well, there's no day camps. So he's been with Joe pretty much weekly. I'm working from home. So we kind of spread it out so that there's something that is going on that I would like Josh to be at, or there's a program on Zoom that he might find interesting. So then he stays home. But most of the time he's been going with Joe. Okay. Great. And are there any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities he's done since leaving the transition program? No, not since everything was done with transition. Okay, great. Great. So that was that one. Now we're going to look at services. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to read through a list of services and ask you whether or not Josh is receiving them. And then if you think he currently needs them. Let me know if you have a question about what the service might be. It already sounds like you know a lot of them. The first round are government programs and then some are direct services. Okay. Okay. So is he currently receiving SSI? Okay. I'm not sure how you can respond to it. He is eligible for SSI. He was receiving payments. Back in 2011, there was a special needs trust that was established due to an inheritance. And this was before it was ... They kind of happened simultaneously. The special needs trust was fine. He was getting SSI. And then it's been about a year now, they decided to say that the trust form was created wrong. Oh no. And they stopped his payments. So we're in the middle of appealing it, which believe me is impacting so many of his programs and benefits. So kind of like, yes, he was receiving it. He is eligible to receive it, but right now we're appealing it because they're saying he has this huge asset. Okay. Okay. So he's not currently getting it. He currently needs it and you're fighting for it. Right. Okay. Right. Appealing. So then I'm guessing he doesn't get SSDI either. No. And he wouldn't be eligible for that. Okay. He hasn't contributed any quarters. And now voc rehab services, you said he was just approved, but it hasn't started yet? Right. He was just approved and we were waiting. I've been over to the store to talk to them to see if they would hire him permanently. They're trying to figure out how that's going to work. But yeah. So he does have an open case with voc rehab. Okay. Does he get any Medicaid waiver services, home based services, anything like that? Through Medicaid? No. He's on the PUNS list. He's supposed to be pulled in the fall of 2021 with being able to use the funds in 2022. He does get home based through Doors. Okay. 2022. Okay. All right. Great. Any Medicaid long term services and supports? This is for people who are usually in some sort of institutional facility. Yeah. No, he doesn't. Okay. I worked for senior services. When I think of Medicaid long term that's what I go to. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. No, he doesn't get that. Okay. Does he get any ... You mentioned a special needs trust. That was the next one. So I'm going to do yes for that. Legal protections. You're his guardian, if I remember correctly, right? No, his father os his legal guardian. His father is his legal guardian, but one of you has guardianship. Okay. Yes. Yes. And then does he get a housing choice voucher or section eight funding? No, he does not. We are in the process of filling out that paperwork to see how we can make that work. Okay. Okay. And then how about SNAP or food stamps? Does he get those? We just applied for SNAP. We had been claiming him on our taxes up into ... So wait, we just filed 19 taxes. So we just stopped in 18 because my husband's income changed. So it was going to push Josh over on his ... They were going to need to include our income. Right, right. Yep. Okay. And then when I changed jobs, everything, so Josh became his own. So he has his own Medicaid established. And why I didn't think to apply for food stamps at the same time, I don't know. But we just put in his application for food stamps at the beginning of July. Okay. All right. Okay. And then for insurance, you said he does get Medicaid? Right. He has his own Medicaid. Okay. And then the rest of these are direct services. Okay. Does he get any speech or language therapy or communication services? No. We are looking into speech and language and also for augmentative communication, because as he is getting older, it's becoming increasingly difficult to communicate with him. Okay. And so like, as far as comprehension and his ability to express himself, that's one thing. That's why we're looking into the augmentative communication. But when he does talk, he has developed a very ... It's a horrible stutter and it wasn't there a few years back. I mean, it was there kind of, and it's been increasing to the point now where it's taking him a good amount of time to actually get the words out. And we think what's happening is by the time that he actually is able to use those words out, he forgets what it is that he was going to say. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So does he have any kind of assisted technology devices right now to help? We have an iPad and when he was in school, they had just started ... They were refusing us to have any type of augmentative communication assessment because they said he was verbal. And I was fighting them back and forth saying that just because he can talk and just because he can speak doesn't mean that he can communicate and get his needs met. Right. And then finally, we knew we were, we weren't going to send him because he turned 22 in October and we knew we weren't going to send him just from August to October. So at his last IEP, I basically said, you're going to get us this evaluation. There's no reason why there isn't one. And I will take you to due process if you don't. And they just said, okay, fine. Oh, lo and behold, it's like, oh, well he would benefit from the use of an iPad. Oh my. Okay. But they're like, but we're not going to give you an iPad because you're only going to be in school for the next four months. So here's what we recommend. I mean, the speech therapist was incredible. She was like, why was I never ... There a whole bunch of questions with that. But she sat down with me and went through the iPad and figured out which programs to use. And then I actually went through iTask, not iTask. One of those. To get the funding, to purchase one of the full versions. And he doesn't use it. Oh my, okay. Okay. So he doesn't like bringing it, he doesn't like using it. And we're thinking that it's kind of a wall where, he's gotten used to everybody and this is his father's thing. Everybody doing everything for him. Okay. So when he has his iPad, he has to do it for himself. Ah, got it. Got it. And he doesn't like that. No, he doesn't like that. So did you have to buy the actual iPad itself? You got that funding for the full version, but did you have to pay for the iPad as well? We were going to have to, but I actually was awarded one through Autism Speaks. Oh, got it. Got it. Otherwise, I mean, we had a tablet just on our phone plan that we were going to use. And we're Android people here, Googling people here. We don't use i-products at all, but I knew that as far as this, for communication stuff, that iPad was the preferred device. So I randomly had just submitted the application and they're like, okay, you got the iPad. I'm like, oh, okay, well that's good to know. Yeah. That's wonderful. That is. Yeah. And then how satisfied are you with that service? The iPad. He doesn't really use it, but I have to ask you anyway, if it's on my survey, not at all, somewhat, very? I mean, we're satisfied with, with the, with the product and how it can be used. I mean, there's some things on the iPad that he uses. Like we downloaded all of his restaurant apps. So he can look through the menu before we get there to try and kind of ease that deer in headlights dealing when he's standing at the register saying what he wants. Absolutely. So we do some work at home. And then there's lots of other apps on there that we've found that are beneficial. It's just, he just flat out refuses to use the communicator. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. I'm glad it's beneficial for some things. Right? Yeah. Does he get any audiology services for hearing problems? No, he does not. Okay. Are they needed? I don't think so. We don't think so. However, with my son's passing, Josh has not adapted very well. None of us have. But he lost a considerable amount of weight. And so we're going through this whole medical thing to find out, is it just depression? Basically with him we're not able to really tell. So in order to rule it being something that's emotional, we ended up having to rule it out of the physical. While trying to rule out all the physical, we found some physicals issue that we weren't aware of. So we're addressing those. But then with the team of doctors, they're just going through and taking care, they're just like, all right, well, he hasn't had an audiology exam since he was five. So why don't we just get that done. So we're trying to find an audiologist that takes his insurance that will work and do a screening for a central auditory processing disorder. Okay. Okay. So that's kind of on our radar. As far as hearing goes, we don't think that he has an issue with hearing, but we're not sure if some of his communication issues might not be more of a processing disorder. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. So have you found someone? No. Not yet. Okay. Okay. I mean, I used ... Well, my daughter had it done. I went through children, but that was fine, but he's 22. Yeah. And he's got the Medicaid. Right? So it's hard. Right. And he's got Medicaid and then, Medicaid's like, well, he's an adult, so I have a feeling that it's going to come down to something that's going to end up private paying for. Yeah. Probably. Does he have a reader or interpreter? That can include sign language. No. No. Okay. Is that needed, do you think? No, he does not know sign language and I don't think we'd be able to teach it to him. What about orientation and mobility services? This is for people with very limited sight or blind altogether. I don't know what his situation is with that. Does he get those services? No. He does not get those services and that's not something that he would need. He goes yearly to have his eyes checked and everything seems to be fine. Okay. How about physical therapy? No, he doesn't have any mobility issues right now. Okay. And did he, or does he get any transportation because of his special needs? I know you mentioned he gets ... Your other kids drive, but does he get anything like pace bus, anything like that? He has a free ride card. Okay. And it's funny. Because I just found paperwork. Because I was trying to find ... About five years ago we did, because they never put anything in his IEP about ... And like, well, how is he supposed to get a job if he can't transport himself. Or use  transportation. And they're like, well, he's not going to get a job. So why is that even ... Huh. Yeah. So we had the assessment done and they felt at that time because he wasn't able to communicate that they didn't feel that he would ... To even complete the exam. And we had the pace guy come out. And I pushed and I'm like, okay. But I suggest from being with him, he knows like, if you tell him to get on the bus here and you tell him to get off the bus at school, he won't get off the bus. And he can go and say all of my husband's job sites from 10 years ago, he's like, oh dad, that's your work. So he remembers that. And we didn't have any questions about that. And it's like, okay, well then especially if he has the iPad, then it could just say, this is my stop. Yeah. And pace was ... So once I brought that up, pace was like, okay, well you guys don't live on an active bus route. And at the time we lived on a farm in an unincorporated area. Yeah. So even though the bus drove past our house and dollar a ride would come to our house, we weren't on a bus route. So that kind of stopped. And then we moved into the house that we're in now about two and a half years ago. And we were on a bus route. So I tried to find the number and just came across it. So I called them, they were going to come out and do another assessment and then COVID happened. Oh, okay. So it was going to happen before? Yeah. It was right in March when everything was just ... And they're like, okay, we'll come out. And then they're like, well, no, now we can't come out and they're like, you can bring him down to ... You can bring him out to Rockford and do it at the depot there. And then they're like, well, no, now we're not going to do it at all. So he currently then does not have the free bus card. That's what you're working on getting him? He does have a free bus card, but there's no ... Because what we're looking for is they would do transportation training with him. Okay. And he doesn't have that, but he does have the free bus card. Okay. Thank you. Yep. And it's so hard to know when life's going to get back to normal, to get all these services in place again. How about nursing care? Does he get any of that? No, he does not have nursing care. Okay. Is it currently needed? No. What about, does he have a personal assistant or an in the home aid? His father's hired as his PSW. Okay. And that's paid for through the waiver, through Doors? It's paid for through Doors. Yeah. Okay. And then how satisfied are you with that setup? Not at all, somewhat, very? No, it works. Okay. So there's a lot of things that Josh doesn't want me to do. Like check to make sure that after he goes to the bathroom that he's clean or when he's showering and things like that. So my husband and I really share the duties. It's just, my husband is his paid worker. Okay. Do the two of you get any respite care? We get respite services through NISRA. They award us $800 a year and we use that to pay for camp. Okay. So technically they are respite funds, but when my kids were little, we had a respite worker that would come in once a week, which was fantastic, but we don't have that type of respite. Okay. And then how satisfied are you with the type of respite you have now? The $800 and being able to pay for camp? Yeah, we're very happy with that. Because otherwise camp would be something that wasn't in our budget. Okay. Does he get any social work services? No. Oh, he sees a psychologist. Okay. So I'm not sure if that's further on down. That's the next one I was going to ask you. So how often does he see somebody? A psychologist. Weekly. Okay. And do you have to pay for that service? It's through his insurance. And how satisfied are you with that so far? So far we're very satisfied with it. Okay. Paid for through his insurance. Okay. And then how about any medical? Does he get any medical services for diagnosis or evaluations that are related to his disability? Like epilepsy, sleep issues. Basically it's like, does he see any specialists for other things? Yes. He sees neurologists for sleep issues and suspected seizures. In fact, he was just there yesterday. He sees Dr. Smith at RUSH and he's wanting to redo his MRI and his EEG because Josh started toe walking. Okay. And he's losing some previously acquired skills and we're not sure if that's depression or if there's something neurological going on. He also was just diagnosed, this was last week. Like I said, we just did this whole July has been pretty busy. He has some type of esophagus issue where there's scarring in his esophagus and constant gastritis. So, which they think has to do with an undiagnosed food allergy. So he has allergy testing done, today is Thursday. He had allergy testing done Tuesday and we're supposed to find out the results either tomorrow or in the beginning of next week to find out if there's the food allergy. So they'll be followed by the GI to see what is going on with that. Okay. And then for the neurology, for the neurologist, do you have to pay for that service? That's from the insurance. Okay. Covered by his insurance. Yeah. Covered by his insurance. Okay. And then how satisfied are you with the neurologist so far? Very satisfied. Okay. Good. All right. And then you mentioned that he goes to GiGi's Playhouse to learn some sort of ... The teen class. So because the next one I was going to ask you is about training and independent living skills. That would kind of count right? For the GiGi's Playhouse that you were describing. Yeah. Okay. And then Let me see. I'm sorry. How satisfied are you with that? I was very satisfied. Unfortunately it ended because of COVID and it had to start back up again. But when we were doing it, we were very satisfied. Okay. And then how did you pay for that one? That is free. Okay. Nice. Does he get any housing or services like a supervised group home? No, he does not. Okay. And do you feel that's currently needed? We are contemplating group home when he gets pulled from the PUNS list. Okay. So in a few years. Right. Okay. And does he get any vocational services? I don't know if you mentioned this at the GiGi's Playhouse, does he get any kind of job training, career counseling, anything like that? Help finding a job? No, that would be through Doors, but that hasn't started yet. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then how about any financial aid to help pay for the training or tutoring that he gets at GiGi's Playhouse. Do you get anything like that? No, he doesn't. Okay. Is it currently needed? It is needed. Okay. And then yes, he gets tutoring. How satisfied are you with the tutoring that he gets in math and literacy? Oh, extremely, extremely satisfied. And do you have to pay for that? No, we don't. Great. I love it. Does he go to an adult daycare or adult day center? No, he does not. That would also be something that we're looking into when he gets pulled from PUNS to use that funding. We were made aware of, oh, I forgot what it was called. Some funding that we can use through Pioneer Center out here in the McHenry, but we are not happy with Pioneer Center. Okay. Why not? I also part-time with the Advocacy Alliance, Self-Advocacy Alliance and the Pioneer group is one of my groups and I'm in there quite a bit. And when they know I'm coming, it looks extremely different from when I just show up in surprise them. Oh, that's not good. And the one time that I came in, because I was meeting with ... It's like, I wasn't on the list. They know when our meetings are, but I had come in to talk to the facilitator of the meeting of Pioneer, so I just showed up there. And what I walked in on was a group of adults sitting on the floor with one of the DSPs going over the calendar and the day of the week and what they should be wearing. Okay. Yeah. And I'm like, wow. I was a preschool teacher and a former wife and I did this with my two year old. Right. Yeah. And so I mean, I have other groups that ... And I've been in other facilities and in other day programs and we were actually going to be driving him out to North Point in Zion because they had a program that was a little bit more adult and a little bit more ... They were letting them make their choices as opposed to, okay, well, here's your choice. Everybody's going to be doing video games. So you can either do Wii, or you can either do PlayStation. I'm like, okay, well that's not really a choice. No, it's not, it's not, no. No, that's not a choice. So I kind of had an issue with that. So North Point in Zion was a lot different. There's people doing different activities at different times. Okay. But without funding we're not doing anything. Okay. And does he have a case manager or someone who coordinates the services that he receives? Yeah, that would be me. Okay. Anyone else? No. There's no one else. Okay. Would you say it's currently needed? It would be nice. I do case management, that's what I do. So it's just naturally I do it for him. It just sometimes it gets sticky with me and his dad because we'll disagree on kind of the direction to go. And okay, well, Josh should really be doing things with 23 year olds and 22 year olds and stuff without us. And he's just like, right. But he doesn't know how to cross the street by himself. I'm like, okay. But we can work around that. Yeah. Yeah. So it would be nice to have someone else come in sort of as a neutral party case manager? Yes. It really would. Okay. So last question really. Or last two. Does he get any other services I didn't mention because of his special needs? Something popped in my head, but then it went away. I don't think so. Okay. No, I don't think so. Okay. And are there any you think that he currently needs that I didn't mention? No. Not that you didn't mention. I can't think of anything. Okay. Cool. And then last question, is he on a waiting list besides the PUNS list for any other services? No, he's not. Okay. You mentioned job training and this is just anecdotal. The Barbara Olsen Center of Hope out in Rockford, they were starting a job training program. It was a six week program where they would go and they would just take them in different areas. Like if they wanted to learn how to shred, if they wanted to learn how to do this and it was completely free. And it wasn't just open to those residents. So he was registered for that program and then the first day that he was supposed to go there was the day that they closed the center. Oh. Because of COVID? Because of COVID. So if that is a program that will open back up again and-\n",
            "finishOkay. And so is she still in high school? She is. She's a senior. That's exciting. And you said she has worked during high school before, and it sounded like two jobs? Yeah. One was for a semester at a pizza place and the other was at a Mexican restaurant for actually just a couple weeks. And you said one of these was through school programming? They both were. Both were. Okay, and did she receive payment at those jobs? No. So the pizza place is the one that she had the longest? Yeah. I'll write that down. And she didn't leave because she was fired or anything like that, it was truly a school job work thing. What was the name of the pizza store? Uncle Maddio's. M-A-D-D-I-O-S I'm glad you said that because I completely misspelled it. So she found it through school? Yeah. She has a really good school. Her school, their junior and senior year will go around to local places like our public center Krogers and stuff like that and then they will see what the kids are interested in doing. And a bunch of them were interested in doing some restaurant work and Aubrey was one of those. And so they got a group to go over there. But the school sets it all up. They transport them, they stay with them and transport them back. So it's a really nice job share program. It sounds like it. They have a pet store they do that with. Nice. Several restaurants, grocery stores. And on average, how many hours a week did she work there? I think she was only there maybe 10 hours a week. And do you remember the month and year she started working there? I think she started in October of '18. And do you remember about when she stopped working there? It was around Christmas break, so December of '18. But I guess when I say last year I meant last school year. No, it was '19. I'm sorry. I do that all the time  2020 doesn't feel like a real year. No, it doesn't. That's correct. Because she started her next semester with  and then that's when COVID hit. So that's correct. Shit feels like longer than... It's been six months. And can you tell me a little bit about the job and what she did there? What? Pizza place? Mm-hmm . Well, actually both places. She helped clear tables, write things down. She actually got to help make some pizzas and mix some dough. But for the most part, she was actually cleaning up and helping, she did some floor sweeping and spraying tables down and that kind of thing. And did she receive support while working? Yes. And what kinds of supports did she receive? There were, I'm not sure if they're called job coaches, but that's the concept she had. There were teacher adult support and also some kids who were not in the program, or I guess in special ed. They were some typical kids that went with them and did some work there too. That's awesome. Just like a job share. There was probably four or five kids in Aubrey's class that went, so it was a pretty good group. I think they did a lot of prep for the day. They went earlier in the day. And do you think this job was a good fit for her skills and interests? I think so. And what made it a good fit? She's a very social person. She is not typical of your autistic kid who they don't speak, or even though they can, they don't put themselves out there. Aubrey will walk right up to you and ask you your name and she'll introduce herself and she'll ask you something about yourself. I mean, she has very good communication skills, one on one. And so she's very social, which is, I know, not the norm, but she has done really well. That's great. And so do you think that this was good for bringing out a good platform for her or good space for her for developing those social skills or using them? It was for using them. She had them before that. It just gave her another opportunity to meet. She loves to meet people. She is very much a people person. That's how she is. I didn't even think about this, but she helps run a coffee shop at school. Wow. Before COVID, of course they don't do it now. But she is one of the ones that worked it every morning. She was there bright and early and she helped get the coffee ready and do all that. I totally forgot about that. They jokingly named it Coffee and Compliments because Aubrey is, \"I really like your shirt. I love your hair.\" She wants to be liked, so she finds something that she likes about you and she'll tell you that she likes it. That's so sweet. She's the sweetest kid. She really is. I know she's mine and I'm biased, but she's a very sweet child. She sounds like it. She sounds awesome. She is very awesome. And how long was she working at Coffee and Compliments? She did that all of last year. Okay. Wow. And even when at an extra time, there was a craft fair at the high school where she goes and she even went in on a Saturday morning, early, early. I took her over and I stopped, ran and grabbed some donuts. So we had some donuts to give her the coffee and she worked the craft fair and she stayed the entire time. So she enjoys doing it. And so how many hours per week would she generally do Coffee and Compliments? I would say she did about 10 because I think it was for a couple hours in the morning that they did it. And this was- She did that about 7:15. ... at the school campus? Yeah. And for this one, do you remember about what month and year she started it? I think it was around, I want to say maybe November of '19. No, it was before that. It was probably about September, right after they started school, I think. And until COVID? Yeah, until COVID. It took them about a month to get everything set up. They got a coffee distributor to donate everything and they donated all the coffee, all the extras, the pots, everything. So it took them a little bit to get that set up and get it going. So it was September. And did she receive support while working? Yes. Her teacher. And you said she helped get coffees ready. What were her job duties? She actually helped start the coffee brewing in the morning. So she helped measure out and do things like that as far as what she needed, she would make sure that the sugars and the creamers and stuff were stocked. And then once she started serving, she made sure they had enough cups. And if they got low on coffee she let them know before it ran out. So she remembered how to gauge, how far, how much they had used and she helped set up and tear down. So she did a lot of work with that. Sounds like it. Because she's a huge hubber. She did all that, I think. That's amazing. And so it sounds like it was a good fit. What all made it a good fit for her? One more time, I think I interrupted you. No problem. So it sounds like it was a good fit. So what made it a good fit for her? I think the interaction with people was part of the draw for that for her, because they were students and teachers that came and bought coffee from her. And so she got to know them and just seeing that many people her age and teachers that she had class with or things like that stopping by and she got to talk to them, a lot of it was the social aspect. Great. And did she volunteer in the community at all during high school? No. Okay, great. So this one is done-\n",
            "finishOkay. And so earlier you said that she graduated high school. Is she still receiving any services through the school system, like through a transition program? She's not. That's one of the things I'm going to look into. Okay. And when did she graduate? In May. Oh, that's so exciting. And you mentioned that you'll look into a transition program, but she's not currently in one. Right. Okay. And so now I'd like to have an idea of how she normally spends her time. So what does a typical week look like for her? How has she been spending her time? I'm off on Mondays, so generally she goes with me, we run errands and grocery shopping and stuff like that. And we usually go to lunch and run around like that. But then when I'm working, she's generally in her room, which is where she really prefers to be. But she talks to friends. She has a lot of friends that have graduated also, so she gets online with them. And she works on craft projects. She has chores that she does here and those involve helping with housekeeping and she takes care of her cat, and we live way out in the country but we live on my sister's property and we live behind her so she helps take care of their dog. She goes and lets her out during the day, since she's home. And she used to let, they have chickens that are back here behind us, so she used to let them in and out and gather the eggs, but she doesn't do that anymore. They quit letting them out because they were getting attacked. She keeps pretty busy and she has things she does all day during the week. Thursday and Saturday she works. She works about four hours at a time. They're talking about putting her on as paid, but they're working with her to work more independently. The place that she works for is a thrift store, that actually is, all of the workers there, except for some supervisory folks, all are people with disabilities. Oh, that's great. It's really nice. And so they work with her also. So it's sort of a transition, but it's not official, but they're working with her to be more independent. And so you mentioned that she works four hours at a time, two days a week. So about eight hours total? Yeah. Okay, great. And so now, has she been enrolled in any sort of academic program at a vocational school community college or college or university since the last time we spoke? No, she does not want to. And now I'd love to learn more about where she's currently volunteering and what is the name of the business where she's volunteering? It's called Thrift Love. And can you describe this activity and what she does there? They, of course, accept donations from the community. And she goes in and helps them sort things out, especially clothes, because of course that's a lot of things they get. So she helps sort them into the correct sizes and whether it's a men or a women or a baby or whatever. And then she puts them into different sizes in those categories. Great. And does she receive supports while participating? She does. I don't think it's as much as she could probably use, but they're limited on volunteers I think. And what types of supports does she receive? I think it's just some side by side assistance, guidance, really, more verbal. And you mentioned that she's not currently paid at this activity, but they are thinking about moving her to paid? Yes. And how did she find this activity? Well, I found it when I was looking on Facebook and somebody was asking about a thrift store and they said, \"Well this place is starting up.\" And so I found out who had started it. So I contacted her, and after talking to Aubrey and seeing if that's something she wanted to do and contacted them. And when they opened in July, she started working with them. That's great. And do you think it's been a good fit for her skills and interests? I think so. And what makes it a good fit? It's a repetitive thing she can do. I don't know how much she works in the front, or the store part, but she is a people person, so she likes being around people. But I know it's something I know she can do and she does it. I'm just not sure how well she stays on task but what she's doing are things that she has been doing for several years here at home. So I know it's something that she's comfortable with and that's her big thing is being comfortable with what she does. Of course. That's great that she's found something that she's so comfortable with. Yeah. And do you have any additional comments about this activity? No. I know they're a good thing, especially in this community. It's something that I think a lot of people in this community rallied around, which is good. Great. And so has she participated in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities besides this one since the last time we spoke? No, this is it. Okay. And so now we'll move on to talking about some goals that we set last.\n",
            "finishOkay. And so could you briefly describe his current high school situation? He rides the bus to school, takes inclusion classes. He does have access to a classroom with more supports that he can go to during his regular classes if he needs to. He does not participate in any extracurricular activities. Even the clubs I signed him up for, for gaming, he's not interested in. He does have friends at school. He does spend time with them away from school until we got this science class. And now we just don't have the time for that right now, but he goes to school and comes home and that's pretty much it. Okay. And so earlier you mentioned that he's going to be graduating in a few weeks, and I was wondering, did his high school graduate plans or track change since the last time we spoke last August? Not really, I guess. He's still graduating and all that's still on and he's going to walk and everything's still going forward. It's not in the same place, but I don't think that was ever an issue for us or him. And is he currently, or actually you've already mentioned that he's not currently working? No. And what are the barriers to him working at this time? Time due to his additional school hours that are required for him to graduate. And driving. And has he worked and left any jobs since we last spoke in August? No. And what about volunteering in the community? He has not. And Is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share? I don't think so. We were very concerned about him graduating with the gen ed diploma. The school said that even if he failed one of his classes here at the very end, that he could still walk with the class and still receive the little leather binder. Now he would be issued a sped diploma later, but we could actually come back and retake whatever courses he failed over the summer or fall. And he could still earn his gen ed diploma. So our plans for him graduating and walking and still getting his gen ed diploma, there seems to be at least a plan B. And that was very encouraging because it's been extremely stressful for me not knowing. I thought whatever he had done by May 22nd was the end all be all of what diploma he would receive. And the difference between a sped diploma and a gen ed diploma, when you're looking for employment is a pretty big deal for someone like Cole, who is very, very capable of living on his own. His family believes that, some of his school people that are close to him believe that. He may need some minor support, like helping making financial decisions and stuff, but he has the ability to earn a living on his own and make his own decisions. And we want that for him so badly and a sped diploma would've made things more difficult for him. Well, I'm really glad to hear that he has that security of being able to get the gen ed diploma, even if not now, later in the summer. That's great. Yeah. And when he was first diagnosed, his symptoms, be because of all the therapies he's doing so much better, but in the beginning I thought I would be that parent that would raise my child for 65 years and then make plans for them to live without me. Through all the different therapies and things that we've been through and the school supports and all the things that we've done and he's done, now he has this opportunity and I want him to take it. I want to do everything I can to support that. So we're extremely fortunate. I just want to keep the momentum going and keep him looking for his own space in this world and his own life and being able to live that. Of course.\n",
            "finishAnd so you've mentioned that he is still in high school. Say what now? You mentioned earlier that he's still in high school. Yes. Yes. And did his high school plans or track changed since the last time we spoke? Like with how long he's planning to stay in high school? No, like I said, he's going to stay until he is 21. Until he is 21. Yeah. He turned 18 last year, and he graduated last year, but because of COVID, he didn't get a chance to walk. And so they're letting him walk this year with the graduating class, But he is still going there until he's 21. Like extended high school. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And so do you know the month and year that he's planning on graduating then? Or leaving the school system? May 2023. 23. We think it's May 2023 is what we think. Okay. And you mentioned earlier that he is working through Voc Rehab. How many jobs is he currently working? Just one. He's working in the cafeteria. Oh, great. And does he receive payment at this job? Yes. And so he's working at a cafeteria. And is this job at school or on campus or in the community off campus? He works at the middle school cafeteria, which is like right next door- Oh, okay. To the school that he's in. And how did he find this job? His teacher and them. I think the Voc Rehab got it for him. But it's because... Hey  Didn't Voc Rehab isn't that who got him the job? Yeah. Yeah. Voc Rehab is the one who got him the job there. How many hours a week on average does he work at this job? Put in four hours a day, like three days a week. So right now he's putting about 12 to 18 hours a week right now. 12 to 18 hours a week. Okay. And do you remember the month and year that he began working at this job? In March of this year. March of this year. Okay. And is this job part of school programming? Isn't the job part of school program? Yes. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit about the job and what he does there? He- He has a job coach. Has a job coach with him at all times and he puts the juice boxes and stuff up where the kids can get them and fills fruit cups and puts them up on the thing. I think he helps load and unload the dishwasher. Throws trash. And helps them unload trucks and stuff. Great. And you mentioned that he has a job coach with him the whole time? Yes. And does he have- Yes, he has a job coach with him. Great. And does he receive any other supports? No. No. And do you think that this job is a good fit for his skills and interests? Yes. Oh yeah. And  what makes it a good fit for him? They work with him and it sees around people he's familiar with. And has he worked and left any jobs before this one, since August of 2020? No. Okay. No, this is his first job. Oh, that's so exciting. And has he volunteered in the community during high school? Since the last time we spoke? No. Okay. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you'd like to share with us? No, I think that's it. Okay, great. Well-\n",
            "finishAll right, so we're going to start by... So last time we spoke a year ago, we discussed, activities that he'd been involved in, and we'd love to hear what Brendan is doing now. I mean, a little bit more than what you've already told me. We'll start by talking about his high school experience. So can you just describe... And now we understand that he's out of high school, but we kind of are trying to gather information about their high school experience sort of as a big chunk of data. So if you could just tell me his high school situation, like when did he start the transition program and you said he just right in April? Mm-hmm . Right. So when you talk about the high school, are you talking about the regular, Downers Grove high school that we went to? That was from freshman year through senior year. Are you talking about the four years after that were transition? The four years after. So just give me some dates is really what I'm asking. So when did he... So he graduated from the high school and then went into the transition program at the same high school? Yes. But it's a different building. Okay. Yeah. Because the transitioning was for Downers North and Downers South it's called T99 and that's the transition program. Okay. And he was in that one for how many years? Actually, almost four years, because he turned 18 in April. He graduated high school in June and then he stayed in the program until he turned in 22 again in April. So he was literally almost the entire four years. Okay. Okay. And did any of his high school track or plans changed since we last spoke? Has any of his what? Did any of his plans in terms of leaving transition or sort of his high school, staying in the transition program, did any of those plans change since we spoke last year? Well, yeah, COVID happened. Yes, so COVID happened so he didn't get to have his final overnight and what happened is he was working at the Jewel and then he got let go from the Jewel for touching the customers arm. And that was in... He turned 18 in April of this year. So it would've been in June of 2019 is when that happened. So he had lost his job and then he worked for  for a very short amount of time. And then after they just kind of stopped trying to work with him because there was... Why bother there's... Yeah. Okay. I'm just getting all this in here. Okay. What type of diploma did he receive when he finished? Just in general, high school diploma. Okay. Okay. So for the rest of the interview, I'm just going to ask you a little bit more about the academic programs, employment, volunteering, anything that he's done since we met this time last year. Sure. And you've said this to me before, but because I didn't have this box to type into, I'm just going to ask you one more time. Could you kind of describe how he spends his time during a typical week? So what does a typical week look like for him right now? He plays in his room on his phone. He just started the Y he's decided that he wants to exercise. So far every day, this week he has gone to either the YMCA to walk the track or do the treadmill, or he has... We have exercise bike in the living room for my hip that I can't use yet. So he's been... He started at five minutes, three times a day. And then the next day was six minutes, three times a day. So he's up to nine minutes, three times a day. Today, which he hasn't done because he spent an hour and a half at the Y. So he wants to be more fit and he wants to eat better and he wants to lose weight. But that still means he is still sitting in his room eating whatever he can snag on the refrigerator when I'm not looking and playing at his phone. Okay. So his room is a mess. He doesn't take care of his laundry. He doesn't clean his room, but what 22 year old boy does. So I'm really not sure what I'm supposed to do on this one. Usually, I would go in there about once every week or so and clean up his room for him, pick up all the garbage and yell at him for leaving everything, such a mess. And he always responds with, \"Yes, mom, I'll take care of it, mom. You've got it, mom.\" But then he doesn't actually follow through on it. Since my hip, I am not allowed... Well, not allowed, but I can't really get in there with a walker too easily. So it's kind of really big mess right now. But no, he doesn't really do much of anything. If you let him, he does the typical 22 year old boy thing and he lays in his bed and plays video games. Not that he's a big video gamer. He more... Looks at... Follows different things on the internet. Like right now he's obsessed with the Titanic. So he's reading everything about the Titanic. He went through this with 9/11 for a long time where he obsess with that. Well, now it's the Titanic. So the stuff he is looking at is really not beneficial to anybody at least he is checking every link that goes... \"Here click this link.\" Then he'll click that link. Then it clicks this link and it clicks that just then it clicks. You know what I mean? It's like if it says \"click here,\" even not just a kid you've got to click here. And then every once in a while I have, have to go in and take off the 2,700 new apps that he clicks on his phone because they always come up with again, try this at this app, and this app so he does. So the other day... Like as an example, I went in there and I had to delete literally seven apps for Prudential insurance. Oh boy. Not that we have it. And not that we need anything to do with it, but that's what I'll find a lot of. Click one thing and it says, \"Add this. Add this.\" So he does and next thing you know, he's got 30 pages of useless apps that are taking up all the space in his phone. I would try to snag his phone every week or so so that I can give him some sort of storage. I'm sorry. I'll stop talking so you can catch on. No, no I, yeah, no. I get it. It's interesting as a parent, just listening to some of the realities of COVID and how there's some definitely some similarities across the board. It's hard, isn't it? Oh, is there? Good, good. Yeah. So it's not me being a horrible parent? No, absolutely not. Absolutely not. I mean, just the obsession with the phone. I think, for anyone who's got adolescence has just like... Or young adults, it has just tripled because there's just so much time to be looking at a screen. I don't know. It's hard. During the week you mentioned... So can you tell me a little bit of when does he go to the autism center and when does he go to the job that he has? So the job is on Tuesdays and that's from 10:00 until 1:00. Okay. And right now he has not been going to the Autism Turning Point because they have only been doing online. Next Wednesday, he will do in person. And that will take place on Wednesday, the 20... The 13th will do in person. It'll be Wednesday the 13th... Oh, sorry. It moved. Oh, that's okay. The 18th there's nothing because it's a holiday. So he's only got... It's on Monday typically... Okay. Typically, it's Monday and Wednesday from 9:00 to 1:00. Okay. Okay? Yeah. But he's only going to be doing that 1, 2, 3, like four more times is all that's there. And then I don't know. Like I said he grabbed the... He got mad at the job coach the other day and he yelled at her because she wouldn't let him change the date on a sign. Instead of saying 2021, it just said 21 and that upset him. So he ended up yelling at her and saying, \"Fuck you.\" . And giving her the finger and just getting way out of hand, which lasted 30 seconds. But he still did it. So now they're like, \"Okay, he's got one shot. If he doesn't deal, he's going to be out of the Autism Program for the turning point.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, there's nothing I can do.\" No. And then after that I have no idea what's going to happen after that. Actually, no idea. Because typically by now he's in this program and he should be done at the end of January. And if he doesn't have job placement, which it sounds like he's not. They're like, \"Okay. Thanks, bye. We tried.\" Which is true. I'm not blaming them, but it's completely true. I have no idea what'll happen after that. Can I ask you a few more questions about that? The place, what is the name of the company where he's working currently? Where he works at? Yes. He's working at the Hyatt Lodge in Oak Brook, the old McDonald's building. Okay. Which is an empty hotel that really has nobody there ever. I'm sure. But they use it as a job training site, which is fine. They still pay him $8 an hour or whatever it is. It's $60 every two weeks. He's happy with that. But it's not even just about the money. So it's a job training site. So he receives supports while he's there? Right. Yes. Okay. And what types of supports do they give him? He has Cassidy. Who's his job coach, one on one job coach. Okay. She's a very sweet,  girl. And what does he do at this particular job? Right now, he's just vacuuming the hallways. Oh, that's right. Okay. He's got a big industrial strength vacuum and he goes up and down the hallways, which he's told me that he hates and he doesn't want to do it because it's boring. So when I was talking... Actually right before I talked to you, I was talking to them. I had a meeting with the Turning Point people as to what to do with this last predicament. So they're going to give him one more chance. And if he does not do anything bad between now and the middle of February, then they will try to work again on getting him independently put somewhere else for a job. But they are going to have him start stripping beds and doing other things like that to see if hopefully that's something as opposed to walking up and down a hallway with the same decking cleaner by yourself for three hours that makes his mind not wander. Hopefully, they get them more to do, his mind won't wander as much and gets upset about everything. Yeah. Okay. About how many hours... It's about... Well, you said three hours a week? Yes. And do you remember the month and year that he started the activity? I mean, it was 2020, but what was the month do you... Yeah. He started in... One second . September. Okay. September, somewhere around the end of September, I would say. Thank you. And so a couple more questions... Look at that. Sorry. I'm kind of jumping around here. And was he enrolled at all in any academic programs after he graduated or got out of high school? No. Okay. I didn't think so. I want to make sure. No. After high school ,you mean or Transition? After the Transition high school program? So really basically since last April. No, because of COVID. So there was really nothing you could... Nobody knew anything that was going on. Okay. And- You remember it was like everybody was going to stop... . Because everybody's like, \"Okay, it'll be over in a couple weeks.\" Well, a couple weeks turned into months. It did. And it's... Yeah. I mean, it feels more normal now, but it really it's still so restrictive. Has he participated in any other sort of employment or volunteering activities since we talked last year? No. Okay. And is there anything else you want to add about his job experience since I've talked to you last year? No, if you can give me any resources or help, I really appreciate it. I can ask about that as well when I ask about the food stamps. Yeah. Because like I said, if he doesn't... One more time, which I'm sorry, but against the odds... That's going against the odds that he's going to be perfect and who knows, maybe he'll surprise us, but I don't know if that'll happen. Okay. And if he doesn't do what he's supposed to do and they let him go from this program, I don't know what to do with him. I really don't have any idea. I mean, it's not that I don't because as a parent they do, but as a parent who also works full time, I'm sorry. I don't have all day to go take him here, take him there. In a perfect world, I would get a job right next to him so that I could work with him. So he learned it and do my own job coaching with him because I understood him better than anybody. But I can't do that. No. I wish I could, but I can't. I have a job. I have a job at another child in the household and so... So I will ask. I will try to get some resources for you and I'll send them your way about possible other programs or job... Job programs and some information on the food stamps. And if there's anything else I can try to get you just let me know. I'll do the best that I can to be the middle man. Is there anything else that you want to tell us about or any updates you want to share that we didn't cover? No. I don't think so. Okay. So that it. First off, thank you for taking time to talk with us. We couldn't do this without you.\n",
            "finishI'm not sure if that's what we were talking about. Okay, okay. So what we're starting off with is we're looking at kind of creating a baseline where everyone is with their high school experience. So as far as I understand, so Garrett is in the transition program at his high school? Yep. And when did he graduate? What month? In 2020, but what month was it did he graduate it? I think it was May. Okay, all right. And did his high school track or plans change at all since we last spoke? No, I don't think so. Okay, examples were planning to stay on longer, but then decided to graduate sooner or... Yeah, no, nothing like that. Okay, all right and when is he planning on exiting high school or aging out of high school of the transition program? What year would that be and what month? It would be September of '22. Okay, thank you. Okay, and you answered some of these, just give me one moment. Sure. Has he worked and left any jobs since we spoke last January? Well, he left all of the job experiences that he was having through high school. Okay, okay. That was TJ Maxx and Culver's at the time? Yeah and the church. And the church that's right, right. Okay, I'm just going to ask for more details, just about the one of those three that he held the longest. I know we talked about this last year, but we're just going to pick one. Where... maybe the job where he worked the longest through high school. Is there any one that he worked at longer than the others? I don't know, yeah. Sorry, they just managed all of that at school so I don't know when he started and ended each one. Okay, let's just talk about Culver's. So he found the job. This is through the school program, right? Yes. Okay, sorry, this is repetitive, but we just are trying to do comparisons. Okay and how many hours a week on average did he work at the job? Per week? Okay, I'm guessing it would've been... probably about five hours a week. And can you remember around when he began working at the job? I would guess it was maybe October of '19. Okay, thank you. And when did he stop? It would've been March of '19. Yeah, okay thank you and can you remind me a little bit about what he did on the job? I believe he wiped tables, maybe bused tables and wiped them clean. Okay. Anything else? Not as far as I know. Okay and he received support while working? Yes. And can you tell me sort of the type and amount of support he had? I, again I wasn't there, but I'm guessing he had a job coach who would provide verbal prompts as needed. Was the job coach there, do you think the whole time? I don't know. Okay, that's fair enough. How often or how... okay and reason for leaving would be because the... Of COVID, yeah. Program ended, COVID. Okay and did you think the job was a good fit for Garrett's skills and interests? I think so, yes. And can you tell me a little bit about why? I think that level of complexity is kind of right where he's at and I think it's just enough that he could feel competent and master it... that they could recede the prompts to a point where he could do it successfully without prompts eventually. Okay, great. And so the other jobs were TJ Maxx and the church, right? Yeah. Okay, thanks. And was he paid for any of these jobs? Oh, goodness. Yeah, he was... it was an absolutely minuscule amount of money per hour. I don't even know what it was and the thing that's funny about it is they were supposedly being paid, but the school would send them a check once a year. What? Or something? Yeah. I mean, it's... and they completely missed out on a really great learning opportunity to get paid regularly like anybody else. But for whatever reason, they couldn't... they didn't do that. So we'd get a check very sporadically and it would come in the mail and, addressed to him of course, but it was... there was no regularity to it and there was no way for him to tie this piece of paper to the effort that he put in. So anyway, it was just... that was a missed opportunity on their part. That's too bad. Yeah. That's just ridiculous, once a year? I mean, you just... there's no... you don't get to feel anything. It's just kind of random, not connected. Or once a semester or something like that. It wasn't even regular. It was very strange. Can you give me a quick overview of what he did at TJ Maxx and what he did at the church, please? At TJ Maxx, from what I understand, he would be in the stock room, in the back, and they would sort... they would have boxes of shirts and they would take them out of the boxes and put them on hangers and hang them on a rack by size. Okay. So that was the description I was given once and at the church... I was told what they did was dusted pews. This is the kind of church that didn't have actual pews, they had all of these cushioned chairs that hooked together and you can reconfigure them. And so what they would do is they'd give them this piece of cloth, like a dust rag, and they would have them kind of hit the cushion chairs to kind of dust them. And they would go up and down the rows. And some of us moms, we would talk about this. It's like, what a ridiculous job, this makes no sense at all. And then one of the teachers explained to one of us that the goal is to teach them persistence in a task, to stick with a task until it's done. And so, you've got to go all the way down this row, and then you've got to go all the way down the next row and keep at it until you've finished X number of rows or whatever. And it's like, oh, that's a really good idea. Yeah. I mean, it's... yeah. So it was more of a learning experience than an actual job, but it was worthwhile I think. Right, and building up those sort of persistence and tenacity, right. Building up his tenacity. Yes. Well, that's great. Is there anything else that you want to tell me or us that happened? Any other updates you want to share before we finish between now and last year that we didn't talk about? Gosh, what can I say that we haven't already said? I can't think of anything. It's just that the loss of in-person relationship has been hard for him. He'll wake up in the night crying and he can't verbalize to us why, but sometimes I wonder if that's part of it that he misses his friends and he... well, and that's not the only thing he's missed because of COVID either. I mean, everything else ended too. So he's got no more Special Olympics. He's got no more best buddies. He's got no more... well, Young Life Capernaum that he used to go to, they're doing their best to do it on Zoom and... oh, they did the coolest thing at Halloween. They had a drive-thru Halloween event where he got to wear his costume and sit in the passenger seat of the car and we drove past several stations where he got to lean out the window and throw a ring around the bottle and it was... Wow. It was very cute, yeah. I can't remember what else they did and they would give him candy at every stop and everything, which was neat. And so it was a way to see everybody face-to-face and of course everybody was masked and kept a certain distance from the car, but at least they got to see everybody in person. So that was neat, but it was kind of bittersweet that they finally got to see each other and then isn't it so sad that this becomes a really great... a great event. Yeah, yes. I just keep telling myself, it's temporary and hopefully, some of those things will be able to resume next summer. I don't know, that's me projecting, but yeah. Yeah... and so, yeah. We're hopeful, we're all hopeful. We're all hopeful. So... Well, that was it for us. I just have to ask for you to verify if you don't mind your... we're just-\n",
            "finishIs Lee still receiving services through the school system? She goes through trade school. So that's the only school system she's in. Okay. And so- They'll provide special services she is getting an education. ... Okay. For this section, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that Lee has attended since June, the last time we spoke. But first I'd like to get an idea of how she normally spends her time. So what does a typical week look like for her? Lee goes to school Tuesday through Saturday, from 9:00 to 4:00. And then she works Sunday, Monday. She's off Sunday and Tuesday, so she works Monday and then Wednesday through Saturday. They change it sometimes. Wow. That's a lot. That's five hours a day. And so involved in an education program and with the work that Lee does, is that working independently or with support, and is it paid? Independent. She works as a delivery driver. Okay. And how many total hours does she spend participating in all of these vocational and educational activities? So between school is probably about 30 plus hours, 34 hours a week or 30 something, five days, times 10, seven hours. That's 35 plus about another 35 at work. That's 70 hours between work and school. Wow. That is a lot. Yeah she's just like her momma. Mm-hmm . Well, that's great. And so I'd love to know more about her school program. So what's the name of the school that she's enrolled in? She is going to Paul Mitchell School. And can you tell me a bit about this program? The cosmetology program she's going to be tested when she finishes 1500 hours of schooling to get a state license, to cut hair, color hair, perm hair and do whatever with hair. And you mentioned earlier, this is not a disability specific program. It is a trade school. Okay. Yeah. There are no exceptions for her behavior, for her mood swings, for anything. She just takes it as it goes. Some days she comes home upset and they give her makeup days. They're charging her for the day's she has missed. So either way, it is what it is. And. She's paying the basic $20,000 plus, who knows when she owes the school. Wow. They let us know when it's all over. And does she have an area that she focuses on or just generally everything having to do with caring for hair? Mostly hair. They study a little bit of everything. They've studied nails. And they've studied a couple other things, but mostly it's hair. That's what their main focus is. And is there a number of classes that she takes per semester or is it more like hours per day? It's hours. She has to complete 1500 hours to complete the program. Okay. So that's some class time. Last year was all online. This year some of it's there, some of it's online and then a lot of practicums, they basically go there to work. And do you remember the month and year that Lee started this program? Yeah, I think it was October 2020. Oh, okay. So just about a year ago? Yeah. And you touched on this a little bit, but just confirming, does she receive any supports from the program at all? No. And are- Oh, sorry about that. We applied for financial aid. She didn't qualify. She told the financial counselors, the only person she trusts that she has autism, but there's no special treatment or special plan or anything for her to get through. One of the directors there, one of the lead teachers, is helping her complete it though, to get through it. Okay. And so when she disclosed that she had autism, was she seeking supports and they were not available? I don't know how that went down. Okay. I don't think there are any exceptions other than some teachers, if they understand or if they care, they're working with her now letting her finish the hours, without having to work on clients, because the clients could take two to three hours. If she does it on the mannequin, she can get those things checked off on her to do list. So they've made that exception for her just so she can graduate. And that's only recently. And so it sounds like while there aren't formal support, she does have informal supports from teachers or just teachers who are understanding. Yeah. There's one person there that's understanding, at least while they're there. Hopefully they'll be there until she's done. And just one more question about the supports. Would you describe supports as being needed or not currently needed? I think she's figuring it out. I think it would've been nice to have it. It's always nice to have a little support, but she's figuring it out. She's sticking to it. I'm proud of her. That's great. She's been tough. But she's doing it. She's been doing all these hours and she's hanging in there. That's great to hear that she's been doing well with it. And do you feel that this program has been a good fit for her? I think it's a good skill for her to take with her. I don't think the school itself is a good fit, but I don't think we really have a lot of choices. And what makes it not a very good fit, that particular school? It's Lee's opinion that it's just a money making machine, which is true of all schools. She's a very perceptive young person, but does not handle those things well. She learns that it's a big deal. Instead of, \"Okay, it's just life.\" It's more personal, I think, more an emotional strain for her coping with an injustice of sorts. I'm so sorry. I couldn't quite hear the last thing you said. Yeah. Lee's had an upset childhood from the beginning. She has been obsessed with justice. What's right, what's wrong. And so it just seems wrong to charge kids a bunch of money to go to the school, basically have them working for free and they're not really learning what she thinks they ought to be learning, but they don't get the hands on help that they need. There's not enough teachers or there's not enough support. So it just feels mechanical. And for Lee, she could use a little more support, I think. Of course. And has Lee been enrolled in any other sort of educational program since the last time we spoke in June? No. Okay. And so earlier you mentioned that Lee is currently working and so what is the name of the company or agency or business that Leah's working for? Dominoes. Dominoes? Okay. And you mentioned earlier, I think that she's a delivery driver? Yes. And, and does Lee receive supports here while working? Support what? Receive what? Does Lisa receive any supports at Dominos while working? No. No she doesn't need it though. I think she does well there. She likes it, it's a good fit. Oh great. And I imagine that she is paid at this activity? Yeah. I would hope so. And how did she find this job? She went and applied. Went out on her own and applied for the job. That's great. She sat at home for a year. Last year she had a rough time, didn't want to work. So she just started it this year about six, seven months ago, maybe eight. She was just depressed last year, just trying to figure things out. So she didn't work or go to school. She started school in October, but she got tired of being broke. So she got a job in February, March, May. I don't remember when she started, but she went out on her own and got it. So didn't work or go to school last year. And then this year was very motivated to, is what it sounds like. Yeah. Well she started school in like October last year. So in 2020 at the end of 2020 is when she started school just to focus on something, because I encouraged her to go do something. She was just at home for months and months and months doing nothing. And then being at school and not having money to go do things, motivated her on her own to go get a job. That's great. And you mentioned earlier that it's a good fit for her. What makes it a good fit? She doesn't have to work with people she's not a people lover, that's for sure. She makes her own time. She does well, because she doesn't have habits. She doesn't sit outside and smoke. She gets rewarded. She gets compliments for being the fastest delivery driver and for being the best of the team. That's great. So the regional manager called her out and and gave her pair of glasses with Dominos on it just because she's doing such a great job. Wow. That's amazing that must have felt like such an accomplishment. That's a huge accomplishment. Yeah. To get recognized is good. Oh and glasses with Dominoes. That sounds like so much fun. She likes it and then she works around guys. She gets along better with guys than women, always has. And she works around a lot of guys and that's also a good fit for her too. She enjoys working with guys in goofier in sillier is less drama. Of course. And do you have any additional comments about her Dominos job or anything else that you like to add? Well, she said when she finishes school, she's going to start full time and consider other things. Okay. And has she worked in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last time that we spoke in June? No, no time for that. I can't imagine yeah. It sounds like she's very busy as is. Okay. And so now we'll move on to talking about goals.\n",
            "finishJust wanted to confirm first, before we get started, Lee's high school situation. So, what is Lee's high school situation? Lee took GED and passed. Okay. Did Lee's graduation plans or high school plans change at all since the last time we spoke, last August of 2020? No. No. We took a GED in 2018. 2018. Okay. And do you remember what month that was? October. October. Okay. For the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that Lee's attended since August of 2020, but first I'd like to get an idea of how Lee generally spends her time. What does a typical week look like for Lee and how has she been spending her time? Okay. So the week is, has some school 9:00 to 4:30 and then work from 5:00 to 10:00. With off of work Mondays and Thursdays. And you said, what were the hours again for work, you said 9:00 to 10:00? 5:00. Or 5:00 to 10:00. Okay. That makes a bit more sense as a shift. And you said days off for work were... Which days? Monday and Thursday. Monday and Thursday. Yeah. That's a very busy schedule. Yes. What kind of school program is this? It's just cosmetology school Sorry. I couldn't quite hear, which kind of school? Cosmetology school. Oh cosmetology school, that's great. How many total hours during the week does Lee spend participating in school and work? School and work? Any non sleep time, just about. Let me see school, is from 9:00 to 4:30. What's that about seven and a half hours. Plus work is from 5:00 to 10:00. So about 13 and a half hours a day, Monday through Friday. Now minus two days, so minus is 10 hours. Let me do the math. I can try to calculate that now. 13 and a half times five, and then you said minus 10 hours so that, oh, that's about 58 hours a week. Well, that just Monday through Friday then. We weren't talking about weekends too, when she closes. Oh, wow. Yeah. So that would actually be about 68 hours a week, I think. Yeah, about. A busy week. Yeah. Very busy. Lee likes structure though. Lee really is doing well with that. That's great that Lee is doing so well with that. She's currently enrolled in cosmetology school, correct? Yes. And what is the name of this school or program? Mitchell School... Paul Mitchell School, it's called. Paul Mitchell School. Can you tell me a little bit about this program? They do two days of just classes and two days on the floor working with customers and one day split between classes and customers. So it's five days a week, full time. Most of it is on, half of it is on the floor half of it is in class. Like learning new techniques, watching videos, learning about the business side of it. They do a little bit of everything. Then on the floor, they don't get paid to work. They get tips. Yeah Okay, so not paid when working on the floor, but paid in tips. Yeah. I'm assuming this is not an autism or disability specific program? No. Okay. She told them about her disability when she applied. She told more of the people there. Some days she's triggered more than others because there's music playing, people talking and it can trigger her and it can stress her out, but she's learning to cope. That's great. She'll go sit by herself figure it out. What is her area of study? It's Cosmetology, it's a little bit of everything. It's hair. Mostly. We learn a little bit about males, but it's mostly about hair and she wants to specialize in hair color. What is the average number of classes that she takes per semester? It's not done like that. I really couldn't tell you because it's not like a regular college. They just do... Hold on. All right, just work stuff all right. Oh, no problem. All right, go on. So it sounds like that doesn't apply, since they structure classes differently. It sounds like with the hours that you mentioned, it's definitely full time. Do you remember the month and year that Lee started? The Palm Mitchell School. We are in June, I think we started in December or November. We're about halfway there. We should be finished maybe in October, November. Oh, great. So about November of last year? 2020. And is Lee receiving supports from the program? I'm sorry? Is Lee receiving any supports from the program? Not really. There is no structure for that. It's just figured out, learn how to play along. She's very good at masking. So it helps her cope with difficulties that she might run into. Sometimes she'll just call me and kind of vent, when things are difficult and then she'll go about her day and keep going. She's been a real trooper. She's had days she didn't want to go in though. But I think she's just tired. If you work her too late, then it's going to be hard for her to get in to next day. I've told her cut back some of the work hours because school comes first and then work, but it's nice to have cash and I get it. I was young too. You mentioned that she's not receiving supports from the program and I just wanted to make sure, do you think that supports are needed but that they're not available or that supports are not necessarily needed? They're not available. I think we're getting through, I think we're going to make it. Some days are iffy though, and the support just isn't there. It would be nice to have a little support, but I just think the general community is not educated well enough to understand how to handle or how to treat it, a more comfortable environment for different types of people. You have to do what you have to do. I'm a fighter and I've taught Lee to be a fighter, so she's going to make it through one way or the other. Oh, that's awesome. Do you think that this program has been a good fit for her? I'm sorry. Do you think this program has been a good fit for her? So far I'd say it's 75%. 75%. Yeah. I think some of the personalities, beauty draws a lot of people who are very talkative and that can be bothersome to her. She's not very talkative. I mean she can, she just doesn't like to, especially trivial or, God speak. I talk, it bothers her, just it's pointless to her. It bothers her, so that's not a fit. She's had doubts about going into this at all, because she's like if it's going to be like that at work, I don't want to work there, if I keep projecting. Just wait, just get a skill and then you do with it with you will. Do you have any additional comments about this program? It's a little pricey, but I know how these private schools are they're all expensive. Lee is talking about maybe going to community college when she's done. So she's thinking about other things also, maybe doing something else and just getting a skill, but both continuing school. Is there any other school or program that she has attended since August of 2020? No. Okay. Now we'll talk about the jobs that she's been involved in. You mentioned earlier that she is currently working. Yeah. So what type of job is this? Pizza delivery. Pizza delivery. And what is the name of the company? Sorry? What is the name of the company? Oh, Domino's Domino's. Okay. Can you describe the activity and what she does there? The activities, she has to deliver orders and when there's nothing to deliver, she has to help in the kitchen. Wash dishes, prep pizzas, or box them and do different things, fold boxes, clean. So they keep them busy. But mostly it's just delivering pizzas. Hold on. Okay, go ahead. Sorry. No problem. Does Lee receive supports while participating there? Lee receive supports while participating? I'm so sorry, can you repeat? Oh, no problem. Does Lee receive supports there while participating? No. No. Okay. I imagine Lee is paid at this activity. Yes. And how did Lee find this activity? How did they, sorry? How did Lee find this activity? Oh, Lee was actively applying for jobs and I got an interview and went to the interview. She did a lot of this on her own. So I'm really proud of what she did there, because I had been bugging her for a while to get a job and she wouldn't do it. Okay, I backed off. And I think she just got tired of being broke and finally just started applying. And did this on her own. She didn't want my help. She didn't want anything. She went and did it herself. So proud of her for that. That's great. That's a huge accomplishment. Yes. And on average, how many hours a week does she participate at this job? So I guess it's five hours a day, five days a week, about 25 to 30 hours. Do you remember the month and year that she started with this? She started in May. It's been about a month. Do you think that this job has been a good fit for her skills and interests? Yeah. Yes, actually she really enjoys it. That's great. And what makes it a good fit? I think it is the freedom. She can listen to, she likes listening to, what are you, I call it, what do they call those things? And they listen on the radio. It's like, we're listening to a radio program, but it's on the internet... Podcasts. Podcasts. So yeah. They can listen to podcasts while they're driving. And some of the customers are interesting and it's just very limited social contact. I think that she really enjoys that it's not over, she's not stuck in a building for eight hours. It's just flexible and I think that she likes the flexibility. That's great. That it's a good fit. Do you have any additional comments about this job? I think it's been good for her. She's really good at saving money. She went out and bought a car. So she's got a car payment now. I mean, didn't buy cash, she's got a car payment to build a credit. And she's taking some added on adult responsibilities with this. After a month in the job, it's something that we talked about and that's what she wanted to do. So we went ahead and got her finance and I co-signed and we got, she got a car. That's, that's awesome. That's a huge accomplishment. Has she participated in any other employment or vocational or volunteering activities since we last spoke with you in August of 2020. No. Okay. No, she's too busy I think for anything else. Oh yeah. I can't even imagine given, she sounds very busy. Yeah. Is there anything else that you would like to tell us? Any other updates you'd like to share with us today? No, there's nothing new. Okay. Well, thank you so much for.\n",
            "finishOkay. And so just to confirm, he is out of high school? Correct. And did his high school track or plans change or graduation plans change since the last time we spoke? No. No, I believe he was . So he had already graduated. And so he graduated in, was it May of 2020? He did. And what type of diploma did he receive? A regular diploma. Okay. And so for the rest of the interview, I'm going to ask about academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that he's attended since August 2020. But first I'd like to get an idea of how he spends his time usually. So what does a typical week look like for him and how has he been spending his time? Well, since August, it has really just been school. So he goes to school two days a week and then three days a week then was doing online classes from home. And then those other two were spent with family mostly. And how many total hours do you estimate that he spends completing school related activities or class? Probably 35 to 40 hours a week. Wow. That is very packed. It is difficult. Yes. It just takes a long... He can do it, it just takes a long time. Yeah. That's really impressive. That's a lot of school. Okay. So now I'll talk about his school program. And so what is the name of the school that he's attending? He goes to Motlow State Community College. Okay. Just so let me be clear on that. So he's taking 12 credit hours, but it just takes him the equivalent of a full work week to do that work. Okay. Yes. Yes. That makes sense. Okay. So he's not physically in school, 40 hours a week. Okay. So not taking the actual classes 40 hours a week, but that's related to studying and homework. Yes. And because three of those courses were online courses, so then you really have to go in and watch the video to teach yourself and read. So it's not a specific amount of time. And so that just takes him longer. Yeah, that definitely makes sense. And can you tell me a little bit about his program at Motlow State Community College? Right now he's just taking general education classes. He takes 12 hours a semester. And they're a mix between online and in person. And is this an autism or disability specific program? It is not. Okay. And what is his area of study? Or you said it was general education at this time? Yes. And so if it's 12 hours per semester, is that about four classes or three classes? It's four classes. Four classes? Okay. And I imagine that's considered full time. It is. And you said that he started this program in August of 2020? He did. And does he receive supports from the program? Yes. Through disability services. And what kind of supports does he receive? Extended time on tests. And if he asked for it, he can have copies of those notes or recordings of the lectures. That's great. And do you feel- Yeah. It's helpful. Do you feel this program has been a good fit for him? Yes. So far. And what has made it a good fit? Well, for the most part, they've been very accommodating. So all the teachers have been willing to do extended time for the test. And I think because the courses are online also that he hasn't... He can go at his own pace. So he hasn't had to have as many accommodations. That's great. And do you have any additional comments about this program or any circumstances you'd like to elaborate on? No, I don't think so. Okay. And you mentioned he's not currently participating in a job, but that he was participating in a job until November. And what job was this? He was working at Kroger. Okay. And was he working independently or with onsite supports? Independently. Independently. Okay. And what did he do at this activity? I think they call it courtesy clerk, but he was bagging groceries or retrieving carts. And retrieving carts. And you mentioned he was working independently, but did he receive any sort of supports while participating? Yeah. So he had a counselor through VR and she did go up there to check on him. And if he was having any problems, she contacted management to help him resolve those problems. And then they met weekly for job coaching. But they did that on Zoom. So she didn't go to Kroger with him unless he was having a problem she needed to fix. And- Because it's job coaching... Yeah. I'm just going to say job coaching was excellent. It's the case management through VR. They are the ones that decided to dismiss him because he'd been there for 90 days. Not because the job coach wanted to. And I imagine he was paid at this activity? Yes. And did he find this activity through VR? So, no. Let me remember. Sorry. No problem. I'm going to say. Yes, the job coach helped him. She made contact with the hiring manager first and then helped him complete the application. Yeah. Okay. And how many hours per week was he working at this job? 20. 20. And you mentioned that he... I think you said he started back in August? Or was it a different month? No, I think it was July. July. Okay. Sorry about that. It's okay. It might have been August. Not really. I can't remember. And you said he left in November? Yes. I do know that. And did you feel like this was a good fit for his skills and interests? No. And why was it not a good fit? Well, I think primarily just because management was disorganized. And so there was just always an issue with his work schedules. And so when you live in a black and white world and you follow all the rules that others do not, that's incredibly frustrating. I think he was just frustrated with management all the time. Yeah. That does sound frustrating. And do you have any additional comments about this job or any circumstances that you would like to explain? . No, I don't think so. Okay. And what was his reason for leaving this job? It was just too much with school. And has he participated in any other employment, vocational, or volunteering activity since August of 2020? No. Okay. And is there anything else that you would like to tell us? Is there any other updates that you would like to share? No, I think that's okay. Okay. Great. Well, thank you so-\n",
            "finishI don't know if it's a really a transition program. Since he has the IEP, he's able to stay in school. The last couple of school years and supposed to maybe this more this year, I don't know if they will, but getting him out and doing various tasks in the community, when they would go to the grocery store and he can help stock shelves. One day they would go to the assisted living center and he would help serve food to the residence or sweep and mop, kind of getting them used to doing work related items. But I don't know that it's really a program per se. Yes. We're from a very small county and there's not a lot of services unless you drive out of county and then it's pick and choose. And because he is still eligible to go to school, he's not eligible for some other stuff. And then with his epilepsy, that limits, because of OSHA laws and what he can do, he has gone out to where they've rotated dates on product coming, grocery shelves. He goes with us every Saturday to do some community service where we load food boxes for underprivileged. And if we don't go on a Saturday, he has to know why we're not going, so. Okay. The activities that he does, more work related or at least the ideas for him to learn some skills that may serve him for a future job, are those weekly activities that he's doing or how often are they happening? During the school year, it was usually at least twice a week. Yeah, and they had been working with them on typing and data entry through type skills.  better typer than his mom. Not saying for one, but For the, so usually twice a week for how many hours, approximately, each time? Two to three? Okay. And were those changing the placements or where they were going a semester or it's always-? They were consistently the same ones. There again, there's not a lot of options. Yeah. And he's not getting paid for his time there? No. It was actually a lot of his teacher thinking upon herself to work with diverse  that she knew would come out. This is the skill I want you try to. Say sure. We can work around it. His daughter actually graduated with today. So, it was, love having and this group and I think one of the children, their grandparents were in the assisted living program or housing that they went to. So it was just trying to help with social skills. And this is how you poor eliminate. Yes. And then you said that on Saturdays, he's doing some volunteering with you guys in the community? Yes. And that's every Saturday for how many hours? Approximately? About two. Two hours. And what is the name of the organization that is, or is it a church or where is it that you guys volunteer at? It's called the Hartsville Backpack Program. Okay. Then it's putting packages for families in need or individuals who do not have food. Yes. I think he kind of takes it apart, but he doesn't want anybody go hungry. And he's never worked during high school? I remember that, you said no. Yeah. It's good to know. So this one is complete and this is the really short one.\n",
            "finishSo first is the program at Lipscomb. So I was wondering if you feel like this program has been a good fit for you? Yeah. So the theater program at Lipscomb, which I originally was in to get a bachelor's in theater, they're really great teachers, but they used to make promises that they didn't keep. For example, they promise every student who gets a BFA and a BA that they will get a chance to be on stage, not just backstage, and that doesn't happen. So I realized that to get my feeder degree at the higher level at Lipscomb, it was harder because it's hard to go to get a job in the theater and to hand them a certificate, only to show them that you've never been on stage. So I ended up transferring the film program, and in the film program I've been able to work behind camera, on the lighting, on the grip and I've been working all aspects. So it's far more better. And on top of that, I've been able to do some acting and stuff. And since they are the sister program to the theater, you're still allowed to take acting classes. I've already taken all my acting credits for the program. So I think honestly, it's just a better fit. That's awesome. I'm really glad you found that then. That sounds great. Yeah, it's great. And I know that a lot of famous people, not widely famous, well maybe except for one, Larry the Cucumber, he's a professor there, which is great. Wow. He features on my TikTok a lot, but not really the point. But they're all really nice, they're all really supportive. I'd never held an actual film camera until maybe a year ago. And I went into this program as a transfer, and so they were all like, \"Oh, it's okay. Instead of doing this, you can do this and it'll be fine.\" So they're really understanding. They want you to just get the material rather than perfecting things. They want you to get experience, but they're also willing to work with you, and that's something that the theater department just never had. So it was really great. Still is really great. That's awesome. And film was also just really cool too. Yeah. Okay. So next, your dad was telling me too about Columbia State. Do you feel like that program was a good fit? Well, it doesn't exist anymore, sadly. Oh, okay. Or was it a good fit at the time then? It was kind of a good fit, but kind of not. What I really liked is for a lot of stage performances in colleges, the people working backstage aren't usually the actors themselves. But every production we did at Columbia State, there were at least three different volunteers who were stage managers and an extra hand. But then the people who weren't in the scenes were the ones moving the sets around. So they kind of taught us that there's a bigger world than just being on stage, and I really appreciated that, especially for someone who did a lot of backstage tech in high school and stuff. Because when I was a freshman, I noticed that there were a lot of other freshmen who had been on stage, but never really backstage, and they were super ungrateful to the volunteers, they would complain and stuff like that. And I got to see them develop their attitude towards being backstage, because what we would do is we would build our own sets and then in the show, we would move them as well. That sounds really humbling. Yeah. So it was really great to see some of the boiled brats of the program start to get really protective of their sets and then start putting hard work into them. Because there is this one girl whose mother completely spoiled her, owning some kind of acting company, and so at the beginning of my freshman year, she was just completely out of tune with how hard it was to build the sets, to paint them, to keep maintaining them. And by the end of her time in the program, she was making King Trident's throne all by herself and painting it. So it was really great and special. Then the people who owned who run it, again, some of them were super supportive, some of them weren't, some of them played favorites. But I had a dance teacher who would always be extremely harsh on me and I remember I used to cry because I was like, \"Why does she hate me?\" And then it turned out that she was hardest on me because she saw certain potential and stuff. So it was really cool to see that some people didn't play favorites, and instead of playing favorites, they would single out people that they knew could do certain things and they would push us to be better and stuff like that. So I really liked it. It had its ups and downs, like a lot of programs, but it really did set the stage for what I do acting wise today. Set the stage. Oh, that's kind of a pun. That's great. It sounds like it gave you a lot of really good experience. Yeah, it did. It was really, really great. Between that and the film program, that's how I know all the protocols for being an extra on different sets and stuff like that, like what to do during auditions and stuff. Okay. And you graduated from that program, correct? Yes. Okay. I did. And then after I graduated from the program, I spent the next semester participating in their next play while I was finishing up my units. Oh, wow. I was too stubborn to leave. Yeah. Okay. So I'll be sure to write that down. Because it was a two-year program, and instead of just doing two years, I did two years and then one semester. Okay. So now switching gears a little bit to learn about some jobs that you did. So your dad was telling me about Kroger. How did you feel about that one? Was that a good fit for you? So I liked it. I was in click list, which is a bit less high maintenance than the other job there, which is good, because I get stressed really easily. My boss was super understanding. Several times when I just had terrible sleep, he would give me his credit card and say like, \"Go get some breakfast from the breakfast bar, get yourself a cup of coffee.\" He was one of my favorite people, and what we would do for our breaks is we would go to the next restaurant over together with two other Kroger employees, and we would just do Pokemon Go and attack one of the gyms. And so he was super cool and great. But the one thing I didn't like was the pay. It was a great work environment. It taught me a lot of things, especially how to work with people. Now I can go to the Kroger and my mom will call me every now and she'll be like, \"Hey, where's this?\" And I'm like, \"Oh, it's in aisle eight.\" That's awesome. Tell her where it's. Or I used to get calls from her neighbor who moved, but he would come find me specifically or he would call me and he's like, \"I can't find this product.\" I was like, \"Okay. Go to aisle eight, go to the middle, look to the third shelf.\" So it taught me a lot of really good skills and they also taught me how to do stocking. And click list if nobody was doing orders, if it was slow, they would put me with another worker and he would teach me how to stock shelves and how to do that, so that I wasn't just sitting on my butt. So they taught you how to do different parts of the job, even when the job wasn't yours to begin with to do, but he was really cool. And what was your reason for leaving the job? So while I was working there for about... I wasn't working there for a year, but at the time, I was dating a girl and it was up to the ear point, and she had come to visit me in person and we ended up getting engaged. And then I learned that her mom couldn't work because she had an autistic son. Oh, wow. So I decided to move out to Ohio to move in with my fiance at the time. I still talk to her a lot actually. I was just talking to her the other day. Her autistic brother got into a really bad depression fit and became anorexic. I'm sorry to hear that. He was so fat and I saw him yesterday and he was so thin and I was like, \"Did Bubba lose weight?\" And she's like, \"Yeah, he did. He was anorexic.\" And I was like, \"No.\" But he was really great. He and I really made a bond and stuff, so it was really hard to leave. I know for a week after I left, when we broke up, I know he apparently cried and was sobbing every day because he used to always wake up and I would always be in the kitchen. So it set in after a week that I wasn't at the house anymore. Oh, the routine. Yeah. But no, I moved in there to help her mom, and the main goal was that my fiance and I, at the time, ex-fiancee now, we were going to save up money and move into our own apartment near Cincinnati and stuff, or something like that. But then things happened, she started having a heart problem. She's overweight, she was like 300 pounds, so it was starting to affect her heart. And we just had different views. She had this mindset. She came from a domestic abuse relationship with her mom's ex-boyfriend. And when she was younger, her dad would shame her because she's always been overweight. I've seen pictures of her. Some of it's genetics, some of it's just her eating habits, but she just experienced so much trauma that it came to the point where I realized that she didn't want to leave the house because even though it was toxic, it was just what she was familiar with. So we ended up breaking up, but its been a mutual discussion. She updates me on our cats. Oh, that's sweet. We had a lot of cats because it was a small town, so we taken strays during the winter. And there was a runt of the litter that I named Nia, after one of my favorite Supergirl characters. And it was this little tiny cat that was this big, very small for a cat. But when we found her, she had frost bite on her tail and stuff. Oh, poor baby. Yeah. She was my precious baby. She hates everyone. She doesn't like people, she's very skittish, but she's sweet. She sounds like a smoker and it's really funny. Her first batch of kittens, only one survived, one died shortly after birth. But she recently gave batch to three kittens, all of who survived. So my ex-fiance, she updates me on the cat health and stuff. And I told my dad that I would never into a situation like that again. Yeah. It was seven people in a three-bedroom apartment. She and I shared a room. Her brothers shared a room, her mom and her autistic brother, they lived on a bed that was in their living room. They were poor. There were some nights where we just didn't have money for food because I had to save it for gas. But it was also a close-knit thing, so I stuck with it. I wanted to help her mother. That's really sweet of you. It sounds like a challenging situation, for sure. It was. It opened my eyes because I never really thought of... I have a lot of friends that are like, \"Oh, your parents are rich, you have oil paintings.\" And I'm like, \"That doesn't mean anything.\" And it wasn't really until then that I realized, \"Okay, so I guess my parents were a little rich.\" Yeah, a new perspective. Yeah. And about Kroger, was there anything else that you wanted to add? And if not, we can go on to the next one. Not really. It was a pretty decent work environment. I didn't have a lot of problems there. Awesome. The only reason I left was because I moved out of town and in with my ex-fiance. Okay. So the next one is Chuck E. Cheese and I think- Yeah. So the first few months of Chuck E. Cheese- We also wanted to confirm some dates. Your dad estimated that you started around September, 2016 and left in June, 2017. Does that sound about right? Something like that. I was there for about eight months. Okay. And was that a good fit? I really liked it. In fact, the song I was dancing to, it came across on a recommended because I was listening to Disney songs and it was one of the dances I had to learn from Chuck E. Cheese. Oh that's so funny. Screaming. I was like, \"Oh, this is a weird flashback.\" Yeah. I liked some of the workers, but it wasn't a good fit, and I think it was just the person who was in charge at the time. She was super toxic. Chuck E. Cheese. How it works is you take a quiz on the history of Chuck E. Cheese. Oh, wow. If you get a 70 or lower, then you don't get hired, so you have to get an 80 or higher on the quiz, just because there's so much history to it. But I had a manager who, she just wasn't a good person. She only cared about the other managers. She was just rude. She would try to sabotage me to the point where she would try to fire me and corporate was like, \"No. They didn't do anything wrong. You can't fire person for not liking them.\" And that's why I quit. And then what she did is she fired me the day of my last day. She fired me because corporate said, \"If it's their last day, then you can get her off the schedule that way, but you have to say, 'Recommended for rehire.'\" The thing was that she didn't tell me this, another manager messaged me, who was close to me or something. So that's how I know this, which really struck me because she was pretending that it was the kindness of her heart that she had to write down, \"Recommended for rehire.\" And then another manager was like, \"Yeah. So about that. That's not what happened.\" And I was kind of pissed about that. But she would do things, like for instance, Chuck E. Cheese, there's different sections. So there's cashier, there's kitchen, there is party hosting and then there's the game room, and each section has a different training video that you watch and they don't cross train you, so cashier only learns cashier. And what she would do is she would try and force me to do cleaning. I would try to do it the best I could, but she would tell me to do something in another section, and then when I would ask her how to do it, or when I wouldn't do it properly up to her standards, she would get super mad and threatened to fire me. And I was like, \"Listen, this isn't my expertise. I can't just osmosis my way into knowing what to do.\" Yeah. So she was super toxic. And the person before her was super stressed and he just didn't understand instruction. I told him for Easter that I was hanging out with friends and some family at a convention, and he apparently, I guess didn't like that because he pretended that I didn't tell him anything. But I even looked through my phone history and the text... Because I was like, \"Okay, maybe I just thought I worded it this way.\" And no, the text I sent him, I did text him. I also called him. I told all of my managers. It was just so many people there were sabotaged and stuff. And I know a friend now who works there and she said that the environment's just a lot better, but it's not something I would ever go back with. It was a fun time. There were a lot of high school students you could bond with, give advice to about college. But in terms of a work environment, in my situation, it was just toxic. It was toxic. And then a lot of parents didn't like the fact that I was autistic, and so the managers would always take advantage of that. They would send private reviews for their party and they were like, \"Our party host was weird. We didn't like her.\" And when that happens is on file it said I was autistic, so what they were supposed to do is send the thing back saying like, \"We understand you might be uncomfortable, but we don't discriminate, and this worker has autism, so they do things a little bit differently.\" And instead of doing that, they just wouldn't tell them anything, and everything. So I was taken off of parties just because the manager wasn't following protocol and stuff, and it just was so toxic, and so that's why I quit. Yeah. That's really toxic and unfair. Yeah. I loved the work itself. I loved dressing up in the suit and dancing with the kids. I love interacting with the kids at the parties. I had a lot of parents who actually had autistic kids who bonded really well with me, and gave me a lot of tips. And I know the one comment which really sucks, because I had a manager, I finally got her to tell me what happened, because they took me off of parties and then all the managers were refusing to tell me why. And it wasn't until I threatened to quit right then and there, which of course, I actually did quit when I learned about it. But I threatened to quit and so my manager told me it was because a woman from another party, so not the one I was hosting, another party commented on how she didn't like how I interacted with people, how she thought that she was like, \"They didn't interact well with people.\" This wasn't even a woman from my party. This was just a random woman and everything. Yeah. And she was like, \"You were mean.\" And I was like, \"Mean?\" She put a date and it was the one date that I got a $60 tip. And I was like, \"I wasn't mean, obviously.\" Yeah. And I don't know like what it was that she thought it was mean or something, and I was like, maybe... because I know there was a lot of workers there who just weren't nice. So I was like, maybe she just got a name mixed up or whatever. But as protocol says, \"Hey, this person's not rude, they're just autistic. They're just blunt.\" And it's one of the things where they just wouldn't follow the protocol that I was promised to get, and it was bad. Yeah. Well it's good that you're not there anymore then. Yeah. So the next one your dad mentioned working at Pilot in Ohio. Yeah. So in Ohio, I had three jobs. Oh, okay. It was a very small homophobic town, so it was very hard to find jobs there because since I was engaged to a girl, a lot of people didn't want to hire me. So the first one is where she worked, and that was at The Comfort Inn. Okay. I'll write that down. The Comfort Inn. I didn't like it because there was a woman who was very homophobic. She repeatedly tried to sabotage my job. Several workers even went to the manager to tell her, the manager, that this woman was giving me wrong instructions just to try and get me in trouble because she didn't want me around. It was very bad, and then I was moved to a different section of the hotel where she couldn't bother me, and I ended up spraining my wrist, and they completely disregarded the certificate that the doctor said that I wasn't allowed to lift 20 pounds. Or no, it was, I wasn't allowed to lift anything higher than five pounds, and the beds that they had were like 20 pounds and they were like, \"Oh, you can do it with one hand.\" And I'm like, \"No, I can't. Have you ever tried to make a hotel bed with one hand? It's not going to happen.\" Yeah. So I ended up quitting that and then I went to Pilot. Okay. So I'm just going to catch up on some notes. So got moved to another section, where they... So for some of these details about Comfort Inn, it sounds like you didn't receive any supports while you were there. No, I didn't. They didn't give me any support whatsoever. One of the managers tried her best, but it's a small town, so whatever. For instance, I worked front desk first and they were supposed to be paid at least $2 more than housekeeping. They paid housekeeping and front desk like 8.50, and I was like, \"It's not worth it. I'm not cleaning up vomit, I'm not standing up for 10 hours getting paid 8.50.\" The owner of it was a really cheap ass guy. It wasn't okay. I'll definitely put that down. Let's see. So for reasons that you left, it sounds like, as you said, they just didn't treat you well, and also the pay was poor. Yeah. It was mainly the one woman who was homophobic and the fact that when I damaged my wrist, because I came back in a splint with the doctor's note, and then they were like, \"You have to go back and get how many pounds you're allowed to lift.\" And then when I did, they're like, \"Yeah, that sounds like it's bullshit.\" So I was like, \"You know what? If you're going to ruin my wrist again, I'm not going to work for you,\" and so I just quit. So it was again, just toxic. Yeah. And so how many hours a week approximately did you work there? I worked really long hours there, mainly to help support the mother, because during that time, one of her sons accidentally got shot in the leg. Oh, gosh. The boys, they do a lot of hunting. And so they were cleaning a gun while I was at work, and while they were cleaning a gun, they realized... I mean they realized after the fact, but the safety of the gun that they had gotten didn't work, so while they were cleaning it, it shot and went clear through one of the son's legs. So he was out of work and he was one of the sources of income, and so I was working maybe 10-hour shifts. Oh, wow. And how many hours per week do you think, approximately? I only had one day off. So that's like 60 hours a week. Yeah. Like I was getting 600 a week. Something like that. Do you remember the month and year that you started and left that job? Yes. I got the job late July. Of what year? And I left it in October. And what year was this? Was this 2017? 2018. 2018. So I'll say late July to early October? Mm-hmm . Okay. And then from there I went to Pilot. The reason I got hired there is I was trying to find a job that just would hire me for being gay, because a lot of people were like, \"Oh, you're gay.\" Because in Ohio, there is the law. Most states nowadays, you can't discriminate, but Ohio, they never passed that law, so that really sucked for me. But at the time, I was coming out as being non-binary and being pansexual and they were like, \"We don't want you here.\" But there was a guy who moved in from Chicago that bought the rights to the Pilot. So I was filling out stuff and he reached out to me because he had heard the reason that I had quit another job, The Comfort Inn one was because of the homophobic vibes that I got was one of the reasons. And he heard that and he was like, \"Hey, I'll give you a job.\" But that's why I worked at Pilot. He hired me on the spot. He was like, \"So what's your name?\" And I was like, \"Elizabeth.\" He's like, \"Great. Here's a shirt. You start in a week.\" Wow. So he was really great. He was really funny. He was in his 40s and stuff, but it was really great. The reason I quit that job was because I was supposed to go home to my parents because my ex-fiancee and I, at that time had broken up when I was leaving because we broke up in December 2018. So I was going to move back home, but then I think I decided to stay for a few more months. And that was decided two weeks after I quit Pilot. Wow. Were you working- And then got another job. Yeah. So real fast, just to get some more details on this one before going onto the other one. Okay. It sounds like you've had a ton of work experience. Yes. So were you working in this store part of the gas station? No. No, no, no. No, no. So how this Pilot was is it was, so you know how in small towns, how some of them have those truck stops that are rest stops? Mm-hmm . It was that. So I was in charge of running cashier and monitoring the trucks that would weigh. So they would buzz the machine and then we had to put in their weights and stuff like that. I never did any stocking, I never cleaned the bathroom. Technically, I was cashier. Okay. And how did you find this job again? So I was putting in applications and one of the applications, I was really salty. So on the Pilot application online, for the reason why I quit The Comfort Inn is I said, \"Homophobic, toxic environment.\" And so the guy who ran Pilot was like, \"I'm from Chicago.\" He's like, \"I have gay family members. Come in for an interview and I'll hire you.\" Yeah. So I went in the next day and he just gave me a Pilot shirt. I still have it somewhere. Wow. Because he understood that it was a really hard time to get a job and I really needed one. And he was like, \"I don't care what you are, as long as you work for me, it's fine. We're good.\" Yeah. \"As long as you follow my rules, I don't care.\" That's awesome. So did you just find it online? Yeah. So there are only a very limited amount of places to work. The only places to work were a nursing home, but in order to work there, you had to have medical experience, which I didn't. There were two gas stations, a grocery store, just one, a Family Dollar, a Dairy Queen, three hotels and the Pilot. So this was from about October 2018 to December 2018? Mm-hmm . And how many hours a week did you work there? I want to say let's see probably 40 or 60. 40 to 60. Okay. So now, you have another one. Yeah. What was this job? So the last place that would hire me, funny enough, it was an adult store. Oh, your dad had said a bookstore, so that's... No. We didn't really sell a lot of books. Yeah, that's funny. It was mainly DVDs and products, but it was the only place... Honestly, this sounds really weird, but it was the best work experience I've ever had. Oh no, that's fine. Let's see. They taught us how to get over being awkward about talking to things, because when you think about it, these people are coming in and being very vulnerable with you. You have to talk about very awkward topics, and so I spent three months studying a 300-page booklet that was our handbook, and then I had to take a test on it. Wow. You weren't allowed to have anything that was exposing skin. All shorts had to cover a half inch below the knee, so you weren't allowed to show cleavage. You had to wear short sleeves to the point where it covered your elbow line. They preferred button ups. You could only wear the color black or dark purple. So it was a very weird experience, because you think about a lot of stores like that and you think of it being really trashy, but here we are, dressed like business people. You had to wear black dress pants or khakis. So it was really funny, but I learned a lot of good social skills working there. That's awesome. Yeah. And it came to the point where I learned what to do when somebody came in the store to steal. I dealt with that twice and I handled it really well. We dealt with how to do paperwork and stuff like that. One of the rules we had was when it was slow, there were several books related to business, one of which was written for stores like this by a guy who used to work at Disney, and it was about work etiquette. It was called Talking with the Mouse, or something, and it was a really good book. I really liked it. It's the only book about business that I like, so we had a lot of... It was a good experience. It's not a job I would typically like to work for the rest of my life, but in terms of making money, it was pretty decent. And it was one of the things where there were only four of us that were hired to work in the store and it was a very small. So it's actually the number one leading adult store in all of America, but- Wow. Yeah. So it was a very big honor to work there, but I really wanted to go to a conference for it, but I never got the chance to do that, because then I eventually ended up moving back with my parents because I couldn't stay with my ex-fiance forever. Yeah. But it was really great. I learned a lot of social skills. I learned how to talk to customers. I learned how to talk with customers who were very awkward. And that one, the hours differed. Usually, I was working maybe 70 hours. Wow. And since it was just four of us, if one of them couldn't make it, since I was the second closest that lived there, they would call me in. So if I had the gas money or sometimes my manager would literally get me an Uber. She would either get me an Uber or she would pay a friend to come pick me up and take me to the store if she couldn't make it. Wow. That is really supportive. Oh, I forgot. The only people they hire are gay men, females or people who are on the transgender spectrum. They don't hire any kind of hetero man. I thought that was pretty funny. Yeah. I think they did that because they knew the area was just so anti-LGBTQ, and I think they set it up that way so that the people could have jobs that were part of the community. But I never bothered to ask. I was given a job and so I didn't argue. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. So what were your duties at that job? Everything. So how that job worked is we each took turns doing everything. So we each learned how to do janitorial work, which was cleaning and mopping the floors, if they needed it. We learned how to organize stock, we learned how to set up stock. We learned how to take apart the mannequins and dress them up. I was notorious for dressing them up for different holidays. So every time we would get new lingerie for different holidays, I would take apart the mannequins and put party hats on them dress them up. Oh, that's awesome. That's really creative. I know a lot of the customers liked it so much. One guy from Mardi Gras season, he went to Mardi Gras and he got us all special Mardi Gras tops, and Mardi Gras beads and masks and stuff. And he got them for us to keep, but we put them on the mannequins and stuff. So we did everything. We learned how to be the cashier. Like I said, we learned how to do emergency situations like if someone tries to rob you, the etiquette of that. And how did you find that job? I literally was driving to a convention and it was 20 minutes out from the house, and I noticed that they had a sign that said, \"Now hiring.\" So when we got back from our comic convention, I paid one of the brothers to drive me there for the gas money, and my ex-fiancee and I went there just to look around and I put in an application and I was hired two days later. Wow. Okay. Let's see. What else? You worked there, was that from December until when? It was December to late June. I think my last day was June 29th. Okay. And were there any other jobs that you worked that we didn't talk about? Trying to think. I don't think so. I know I did a lot of volunteer work. Oh yeah. So your dad mentioned some volunteer work that you... Let's see. He mentioned volunteer work. I think he talked about going to the hospital. Yeah. So I dressed as different anime characters and superheroes for kids. I'm known as the Nashville Supergirl. So we usually go around Christmas time for the kids who are in the... We go to this hospital that's kind of considered the ghetto hospital. It's for the families that can't afford Vanderbilt Children's Hospital. And starting in our October, we put up a GoFundMe and people donate money and then we used it to buy toys for the kids, because most of their Christmas, their present is literally the treatments that they get. So we go to the cancer ward and terminally ill ward and everything, and we give the kids present dressed as different characters. We do events with the zoo, like Dreamnight and Boo at the Zoo. Sometimes we'll do Make-A-Wish. I've done Make-A-Wish twice. We'll go on cancer walks. My favorite is the buddy walk that we do, which we're doing in October this year. But basically, they're for terminally ill kids and characters get paired with families and you just go on a two-mile walk around the field and the park. And it's really cute, the older kids is so excited to meet their favorite heroes and stuff. How did you find this activity? So I was at a convention dressed as Supergirl and the guy who was dressed as Superman approached me, and he got talking and he asked me if I had done any out-of-convention cosplay, and I had said no. So then he direct me to a group that he was a part of, which is the group that I'm a part of now that does it. So I learned about it from a person who referred me to be their official Supergirl. And how many hours a week on average do you participate in this activity? Well, see, the thing is since we're volunteers, we only do events that come our way. We don't go out specifically looking for jobs. Yeah. I can tell you what our usuals are. It's not really week, it's more like months. Basically, so starting the second Saturday of October, up to Halloween, every Saturday and Sunday, there's something called Boo at the Zoo, which we're a part of, where the workers at the zoo take animals out of their cages to show the kids and pet them. And then there's a section for a meet and greet for the kids to have, which  participate in, but it's like an event for families who have kids and stuff. It's just an event. And that, I would go to maybe three days of it, three nights. And then they have Dreamnight at Zoo, which usually happens in either June or July, depending on the weather and timing, and Dreamnight at the Zoo are for families with kids who have survived, what they assume was terminal illnesses, or even kids who are going through chemo, and parents with autistic kids and handicap. And basically, they close the zoo down early and we dress up as characters and walk around. They have free pizza, they have free beverages, they have free slushies. That's so nice. They open up the rides for free. They take out animals. For instance, last year I got to pet a snow leopard. Wow. It was all I cared about because the person had a snow leopard and it was a little baby, and he handed it to me and he was like, \"Do you want to pet it?\" And I was like, \"Yes, I want to pet it.\" And then I got to pet a skunk and a lot of other creatures, and it's just really fun. There's not really meet and greet moments. It's more like kids will walk up to you and grab your hand, and take you and force you on rides. There's a video on our Facebook page of me with a bunch of Disney princesses on the carousel, and it's really funny because there's just one girl with Snow White, Rapunzel, Merida, and then there's just me a Supergirl and it's super random. But it's really fun. And then we do the centennial Buddy Walk, which usually happens sometime in the summer, but it changes dates, which is just where we do the mile and stuff for awareness. Do you remember what month and year you started volunteering? Mm-hmm . I started that back in 2017. Do you remember around what month? Let's see. So I learned about it Easter of 2017, and I want to say that I started doing it in July. Awesome. You said 2017? Mm-hmm . Okay. It sounds like it has been a really good fit. It has. I love doing it. The people have become my family. Whenever we see each other after we haven't seen each other for months, we get super excited. All of us are a bunch of dorks. In fact, one of the girls, she goes as our black characters. So she's our Tiana and then our Uma from Disney's Descendants. I dress up as Carlos, which I haven't done him recently since Cameron died, the actor who played him. Cameron's Boyce. He was 20 and he ended up dying from epilepsy. Oh, that's awful. So I haven't cosplayed his character just because I'm waiting a bit. I know that's sensitive and I know that a lot of kids know that he died, so seeing his character, they get super emotional. So I've been going a Supergirl and everything. I'm working on fixing up the suit a bit, but the person who does our Uma and our Tiana and a few other of our black characters that are female, she's actually coming actually next week to hang out sometime, so I'm excited about that. But usually after we do events, we'll go to a restaurant and we'll eat and it's super funny because we'll call ahead of time and be like, \"Okay, we have a party of 30. Is there any way you can fit us?\" And then they're like, \"Yeah.\" And we're like, \"Great.\" And then 30 people come in, dressed in costume. So it's a fun experience. I really like it. That's great. And were there any other volunteering activities or is that the main one? Throughout high school, I did soup kitchens and stuff, but that was mainly just for some of the high schools I did, that was just a requirement. We had to get certain service hours because there was a-\n",
            "finish.... be involved in. And so just to confirm, he is currently still in high school? Yes. Did his high school plans or track change since the last time we spoke? No. When is he planning on exiting the school system? That is not clear. We don't have that clear. I mean, I'd say he's probably not going right as he graduates, but within that first year after is what we're all thinking, but we don't have it set in stone. But that's what we're all thinking. Kind of on both sides on the school side. And on this side, when I talk with Greg and stuff, it's kind of what we're looking at. So not clear, but would an estimation be something like May of 2023? Yes, if not sooner. Somewhere in that school year. Okay. And just to confirm, you said earlier that he is not currently working? Correct. This is just something that we ask to everyone, why is he currently working? Well, I think that cognitively he would not be able to be. There would not be transportation for him. I don't have any other resources available to me. I work full time with the school system, so I would not be able to take him to work. And the type of work he'd be able to do, as far as the artwork he wants to do, we still have to find that kind of work. It's not like he can just work at a fast food place around here. Like they weren't watching him, he would just walk out of the building. So he needs to be of an age where he can work and where there's supports in place. I will stay with it... Another thing with the ECF is he's still in a group four where it only allows, I want to say that budgets 15 or 20,000 a year. Which basically is three hours after school for my 10- month school year. And so we're trying to push before he's 18 for a group five, which will almost quadruple that, so that's another thing. I don't have the financial resources to have somebody take him to work and pick him up while I'm at work. There's just a lot of different things. And so that's where we're getting behind right now. Is he's not working right now because there's not a typical job he can do without... He's going to need a lot of supervision. And as far as the kind of work he wants to do in the art field, that's what we're trying to find right now. And that's not usually something that you'll find at the age of 16. Oh, definitely. And just to confirm, you said that he hasn't worked and left any job since the last time we spoke? He's not. He's not ever worked. Has he volunteered in the community since the last time we spoke? No. The only thing he ever did is we went down to the... I want to say Salvation Army. I think that's right. We cooked turkeys when he was about eight or nine years old and that, I don't even think, he understood what he was doing. Is there anything else that you would like to tell us or any other updates that you would like to share? No, just... I think we've about covered everything. Well, thank you so-\n",
            "finishNo problem. I was afraid when she said sometimes the phone just goes down, I thought, \"uh oh\". Yeah. No problem. So I just wanted to confirm that you just said that she graduated college in December correct? That's correct. December 2020. Okay. Do you remember when she exited the high school system? Do you happen to remember the month and year that she exited high school? Entered or left? Left and stopped  Left? You want to say graduated from high school? Either graduated from high school or if she got services after graduation, then when she stopped getting those services. I'm, I'm not, I'm not following the question. Did you say, when did she graduate from high school or where do you mean by service? How are you tying in high school and services? I'm confused by question. Yeah. Sometimes people on the spectrum are offered to stay in high school for longer after they graduate. And so. No, no, that wasn't, that was not the case for us nor we didn't ask or, or get it. Okay. That no. So do you remember the month and year that she graduated high school? Let's see it would've been may of 13 2013? Okay, great. And do you remember the type of diploma that she received? Just regular diploma from high school. Okay. So now we'll talk about her academic programs, employment, and volunteering activities that she's attended since August 2020. But first I'd like to get an idea of how she normally spends her time. So what does a typical week look like for her and how has she been spending her time lately? Well, I'm not as sure of that now because she's living at our house, so I don't have access. My guess is there's an enormous increase in time on electronics, which is hard for us to think about because I don't think it's helpful to her. So I think there's probably been a high increase in that and it concerns me. Because she would tend to gravitate or... I almost think of it as the lowest common denominator,  the choices of activities devolved downward into electronics. So I think it's probably a lot of that. There's, I think she's working a 40 hour week, but with a lot of time just spent in electronics is what I would guess. She doesn't have hobbies. She's not out exercising much. She's just started an exercise program recently that I hope she'll be serious about. She's got a friend that's doing it with her, so that can make it work. But in general, I think there's an enormous amount of time on electronics because she's out of our home and she can do what she wants. And, Yeah. So I don't know. You mentioned that she's working at the zoo. Does she receive supports at that job or does she work independently? She works in independently. Great. She's just a regular employee. So now we'll talk about school programs and you mentioned that she graduated from Lipscomb back in December. So that was Lipscomb, going to make sure I have that down, University. Can you tell me a little bit about the program? The degree was in film and it was a broad degree. It was wasn't drilled into one aspect, script writing or casting or, production lighting, all that kind of stuff. It was a very broad exposure to the film industry: film production, the creative, logistical, technical side, all of it. So it was a broad degree in film. Undergraduate bachelor's degree, a regular bachelor's degree. Was this an autism or disability specific program that she was in? No. No. It was a regular program. Okay. Do you know the number of classes she was taking per semester on average? Oh, golly. I would guess 15. Like five classes of . Five classes, Of Three, five times three, maybe four to five, Four to five? Okay. Classes and maybe three hours average. Some of them were, were four. Some of them were or one or two, so that's my guess is 15 hours. So it sounds like she was a full-time student? Yes. Yes, she was full-time. Do you remember the month and year that she started this program? Well, I mean, it, when you say this program. She went to a community college, but the community college was just a general AA degree Associate of Arts degree. So Liberal Arts degree at junior college. So, but it wasn't, it was another school Columbia State, or she got an AA degree and then she went to Lipscomb. At Lipscomb, she started in theater and then switched over halfway through to films, but there's a lot of overlap, so I don't know exactly what you mean when she started she, Oh yeah, just once she started at Lipscomb University in general. Okay. Then I would say that was probably the fall of 16, 2016, because she took a year off. Let's see 16 to 17, 18,  no 17, fall 2017. So she left the program because she graduated this year  did she receive any supports from the program? Any what, I'm sorry, Any supports from the program? Well, she had what's called accommodations. Yes.Those. Or, Okay. She had some accommodations. Not much. They weren't very effective. For instance, she didn't have a note taker or anything at that level of complexity or cost to the school. She did have some extended times on tests, to some better access to written materials, that instead of requiring note taking, she did have access for instance to the PowerPoints so that could supplement her own note taking. So she had access there. She had additional time, a couple of other things like that, but nothing particularly significant. It was not a huge thing. Do you think that Lipscomb was a good fit for her? Yes I do. What made it a good fit? What level, did you say what level of what makes it good fit? What did you say? Yeah. What made it a good fit for her? Do you think? I would say the atmosphere of the school. Jordan, I was thoroughly impressed with B personally. We are Christians. I am a believer that our faith is important to us as parents. For her, she would, she's in a place now where she would probably identify as not Christian and has an issue with several parts of that faith. What Lipscomb, what surprised me about Lipscomb is it's associated with Christ, which can in some people's minds, be a legalistic approach to faith for they don't have instruments in their churches. So there are certain aspects to the faith base that could have been legalistic and rigorous and restrictive. In fact, it was much more accepting and tolerant of people from very different places, including Elizabeth. She would say, oh, there were jerks and they were, there were times they were completely insensitive and so she would not agree with me. I don't think she has any idea how restrictive of environment could have been. Because I've certainly been familiar with Christian schools where it's much more legalistic in their works, it was a piece of cake where she was compared to a lot of them. So it's all relative. Now compared to a public university where there's no faith based element at all, yes, she had some rules and structure there. But from my perspective and Kathy would agree, that created an environment where many of the people there were caring, compassionate people. I'm not saying they only cared because the rules say you have to care. I'm not saying that all. It's just that, it was their faith was lived out I thought. Many of them and yes some of them were legalistic. I think there was a very inclusive attitude, which, which benefited Elizabeth tremendously, that she wasn't judged and ostracized for being odd or weird. That compassion, empathy was huge and very positive. So I would say very positive things about Lipscomb. That's wonderful. I'm really glad to hear that, to hear those great things about it. Do you have any additional comments about Lipscomb? No. Okay. No. I know that you mentioned that she'd gotten her associates, but was she enrolled in Columbia state since the last time we spoke or was that long beforehand? Columbia state? Yeah. Columbia state was probably two and a half, three years. Cause she didn't do it full time. She took a quarter off or something. Okay. But that was two or three years right after high school. And then there was a break and then she came back and went to Lipscomb. Okay. I just wanted to double check. So now we'll discuss jobs. So you mentioned that she's currently and has a job at the zoo. Can you describe this activity? Okay. Can you describe what, I'm sorry, Can you describe this activity? Well, it's kind of a catchall that includes a lot of activities. Everything from grounds maintenance going around, literally picking up litter and helping visitors to the zoo, all the way to helping care for the animal. So it's a rather broad set of job requirements and it's an entry level. She's not a vet. She's not selling group tickets on the phone. She's out in the zoo and helping manage with the zoo in a whole bunch of different ways, so very broad and therefore interesting to her. She's finding it interesting. That's great. Okay. Does she receive any supports while working? No. I imagine she's paid at this activity and I think you said that earlier. Yes. So how did she find this activity? I know you mentioned a little bit earlier, but I just wanted to ask again about that for more details on that. On details of what? On how she discovered this activity or found this activity. I think she, because it was right there, like a mile and a half from our house location, she was kind of looking up and down this one major road Nolansville road, I think is the name of it. The zoo was just obviously a great candidate. She knew it was there and she loves it. So I think she went in and applied, either online, I think she applied online and then they called and then she went down and interviewed. So I think she really kind of did it on her own. That's great. You said earlier she works 40 hours a week. Yes. You said earlier, I think that she started this in March 2021. I believe so. Yeah. March or yes, I think March 2021 this year. Do you believe this is a good fit for her skills and interests? Yes. I think it's a good fit. What makes it a good fit? I'd say the variety. The variety of things to see and learn it. Number one, number two, I think she's out and about, You know, she's all over the zoo as opposed to say, sitting at a desk or if you're working at grocery store and stocking shelves, it's very limited. She really has a broad exposure to both the facility and even cleaning up, to helping set up things for events; a very broad exposure of opportunities to do things to help that zoo work. That's great. Do you have any additional comments about this job? No, Uh-huh . Okay. Has she been, has she participated in any other employment, vocational, or volunteering activities since the last time we spoke in August 2020? No, I don't think so. Okay, great. Is there anything else that you would like to tell us today or any other updates that you would like to share with us? No, I think... Well, I guess the one thing and I wanted to call back about this, I think there's some... With regard to some of the government services in particular, I wish there were a way to gel it down into something simpler and that's all I can say right now. Really. I don't want to get into anything other than that and I'll call elsewhere about that. Because I think there's some opportunity that I still am confused about a few things and I think it would be nice if it were, some of it were summarized down to a 3x5 card almost, some of the stuff. Because the navigating the public services, it's complicated as you know, or at least know about. So all the more it's even critical to understand before you even start, whether something is viable or not, because you don't spin your wheels, if you're applying for something and you don't have a chance to get it, then why, why bother? So that, I guess that's one thing that I think it seems like it could be, You know, more help to families that, Well, thank you so much for that feedback. That's very helpful for us to know and I really appreciate your honesty with your feedback. Great. So thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today as this would not be possible without your participation.\n",
            "finishAnd then, we can speak with him. Okay. And so, he's no longer in high school, because he graduated? Correct. And did he ever work during high school? He did. He started working for Kroger his senior year. Yeah. So how many jobs did he work total in high school? He had a very brief job at a pizza place and they fired him for eating the pizzas that got messed up. Oh, no. Yeah, I know.  He's very... I'm not going to lie- The free food impulse is kind of hard for a teenager at all but, yeah. ... pretty much everyone I know who's worked in restaurants, including me, has done that too. So that's harsh. There's been no issue since he's gotten his job at Kroger. And he's been there... If it's not already been a year, it's got to be close to it. The job at the pizza place... So none of the jobs were through high school programming, correct? No, this is just, he wanted to get a job and we helped him. Actually one was the pizza thing was just really random. That was just another parent who was a manager at the pizza place. We just happened to see them at a middle school band program. He was like, \"Well, we heard him say he was looking for a job.\" And he said, \"Man, we're hiring. Come apply.\" So he did. And then the Kroger was more our pushing, because it's within walking distance of our home. So it was easy for him. But yeah, nothing was through schooling. Mm-hmm. Okay, and so how did he find the Kroger job? You said you encouraged him to? Mm-hmm . We just had him look at the job website at Kroger and apply. And in fact, he interviewed... I think he applied one time and he didn't even interview, but then called back a few months later and they did have a position open that he interviewed for that he got. So he applied twice? Mm-hmm . And how many hours a week on average does he work? Oh gosh. He probably gets at least 20 hours a week. Oh, that's awesome. And you said it's been about a year. Do you remember the month and year that he began working that job? I don't, but he might. He remembers way better than I do. Yeah, I'll ask him. Since you said about a year, and I'll confirm with him later, but I'll just put July of 2019. Sure. If that sounds about right. Work just phoned me and asked me if I wanted to come in earlier than I- Like what time? I don't know. Sorry, go ahead. Oh, no problem. And can you tell me a little bit about the job. You said he brings in carts and bags groceries. So, he either is bagging... Right, he's either bagging the groceries or bringing in carts and they had recently started having him do some freezer stocking, so is kind of a crosstrain a little bit. That's awesome. They said 12:00. Would that work? Let me see. How, long do you think- Oh, we can be- You'll be with- Ready to speak with him in like five minutes. Oh yeah. And you only need him for like 20? Less. Probably about 10. We can have you there at 12:00. Yeah. And does he receive any support while working? Nope. And do you think that this job has been a good fit for him? Yes, very much. And why has it been a good fit? He is very motivated to earn money and help out. So it's given him a great sense of accomplishment. That's awesome. He was able to pay for half of the senior trip, which unfortunately got canceled because of COVID. They were supposed to go to Spain. Oh, my gosh! I know. So he paid for half of that trip and he's got over $4,000 in savings on top of that. He's doing better than all my college graduated friends. He's got more money in savings than I do. Wow, that's incredible. He's helping out with some of the rotating bills. He sends us the money for his cell phone bill every month and he pays for the Disney+ subscription for the family. And so it's really given him a sense of responsibility and shown him that he can do things and he can be productive in the family. That's awesome. And did he ever volunteer in the community during high school? No. And then the tendency promise volunteer stuff was all made into modules. So he didn't really get that volunteer opportunity this time. And I kind of feel like it'll be that for the next semester as well the way COVID's going. But so now he's not really had any opportunities for that yet, but I think he would like that. And so he's currently involved in his job. So I'll write that down. And so besides working, how has he been spending his time generally? Mostly he really likes watching comedy videos on YouTube and he is got a PlayStation 2 that he got from a friend. So he plays some video games and then when his friends are available, they try to... They've been meeting about once every week or two, like at Starbucks or to go get lunch or something together. He just went to a restaurant and paid and tipped and everything himself, just with him and his friends just this past week. Time with his friends really important to him, but that's mostly it right now until school starts. And when does school start for him? Well, I'm not exactly sure on the date. He's got freshman orientation, which is also going to be Zoom like on August 11th. Honestly, I have to double check. I would think within a week or two after that, I would think. Okay. Okay, and I'll put for a degree in math. And has he already signed up for classes? Not yet. He has to do the orientation part and the school was missing his ACT scores, which he actually took care of himself. He called ACT and they got his account fixed so that he could forward his scores. So he did all that on his own. I coached him a little bit, but he did that himself. And so he needed that in order to be able to sign up for the orientation and they have to have the orientation done before he can sign up for classes. So as soon as that's done, they'll sign up for classes Okay, let's see. And I'll write down... Let's see... Kroger. And some of these questions you already answered above. And I think we're just about ready. Yeah, we're just about ready to speak with him. Okay. I'll go get him. Thank you. Okay, you can sit where I'm sitting. You just got to hold the phone where they can see you. Hey. Hello. Thank you so much for doing this. We really appreciate your time. Oh, no problem. I know you've got work soon, so we won't take up too much of your time, but speaking of work, I just wanted to ask you a few questions about Kroger. Sure. So first of all, do you remember what month and year you started working there? I believe it was either June or July of last year. Oh, awesome. So Mom was about right. So do you feel that working at Kroger has been a good fit for you? Yeah. Yes, I do. And what's made it a good fit? It actually makes the day go by faster. Well, it makes the day go by faster and I get paid pretty good. But then the days now are really slow. Yeah, definitely. It's good that you have something to spend your time with, so you're not just bored all day. Yeah. And is there anything else that you'd like to tell me about Kroger and working there and things you've liked or anything else? Hmm. Nah. Nothing that I can think of. No. Okay, awesome. So, that one is actually-\n",
            "finishSo she has to do contact tracing and stuff still when the numbers are high. So right now that's what she's doing and which is taking a lot of her time away from stuff like looking for services like that. And how has Justin been involved in making decisions around resuming services that were impacted by COVID? He's not really involved much with it. And then what about service providers or agencies? How have they been involved in making decisions to resume services? I think for the most part they're back to where they were before. We're in person and stuff like that. That's all gone back to normal that way. Any overall comments about services before we go to the next section? No, I can't think of any. On, it always takes the computer a second to think as I move on to the next section. Great. So Justin is out of high school, right? Yes. Great. So then what does a typical week look like for Justin? How has he been spending his time? So he'll wake up and his IRIS consultant will show up at the house around about the time he gets up. She will just oversee him getting ready in the morning, doing all his toiletries and getting himself shaved or whatever and that kind of thing. If he need to be that day, helps him with, they do cleaning around the house. They do from day to day, they cook meals. So that way he's got meals ready for him for lunches and stuff. Then it would be either she would help to take him to the Y once in a while, and then he would, and, or I guess, or he would get ready for work and he would go to work. And then days he is not working he would keep himself occupied until family members get home. And then I say he would do his own thing, keep himself occupied with his stuff that he likes to do until supper. And then he would help out with setting the table and then do cleanup after supper and then probably watch TV or play video games with his brothers and go to bed. Typical days of course. Yeah. That's great. So Justin has a job right now. Yeah. And how many hours a week do you think Justin spends at that job? I think it's 38 hours a week. I think it is. Great. And any volunteer work or anything like that in addition to that job? Not at this time, no. Okay, great. And is he currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in any schooling since the last time we spoke? No. All right, so he currently has a job. Sorry this form is, I always feel like not quite in the right order. I guess we missed this question here. All right. Yeah. So where is his job? Farm & Fleet. And what activities does he do at that job? He brings carts in. He does cleaning and stocking of the shelves. And is this a paid job? Yes. And does he need to get any support doing this job? No. His manager probably helps him out, gives him things that he needs to do. I'm sure there's probably cues that he needs like, \"Hey, this is ready so go out and do that or this and that.\" He probably needs to be told that. Great. Yeah, but there's not an outside job coach or  No, it's not an outside job coach. No. Was this the job that your wife found him? Yes, this is. About 30 hours a week. And then what month and year did Justin start this job? Let's see. It was this year. Was that, I think it was July of this year. And do you think that this job is a good fit for Justin's skills and interests? This is probably the best fit as of right now. Yes. And why would you say that? It's a lot of repetition and it's not real fast pace because I think if he was in fast-food it would be disastrous. I just think that this retail seems to work about the best for him. Okay. Any additional comments about this job? Well, I guess. So he does have this thing called Raynaud's disease. I don't know if you've ever heard of it. So what happens is your hands can't handle the cold weather. We're going to try and see if IRIS will pay for it, but getting heated gloves so that he can wear them when he goes out to get the carts. So I guess that's the only thing we're going to try looking into for his job because even gloves don't seem to handle the cold weather. All right. Dante... What? Can you come here please? So upstairs there's a charger for this computer. Can you get that for me please? Excuse me I just got to get my charger or else my computer will die. Okay. Yeah. Great. And just one more time to make sure, is he doing any other employment, vocational, volunteering activities? No. Okay. And anything else that he's done since the last interview, but is not doing now? No. Nothing else. It's all pretty much the same. That's all.\n",
            "finish... develop a more integrated social and emotional life as an adolescent, transitioning to adulthood and having some of those experiences that you would have at college. Also, it's just a amazing metamorphosis to see her engaged and more into a critical thinking mode. And I think that's what's demanded when you have to go from somebody handing you something to having to be more accountable. And is she currently taking classes right now? She is. Okay. And are those virtual or in person? She's in the online live course. Courses. Okay. And I should also say that the other academic program that she's involved in is the TRIO program at Madison Area Technical College, and that's been a lifesaver, actually, for the fact that the Verona Area School District did very little to help transition her there, the TRIO program has been phenomenal in having a consistent counselor who provides advice and direction on instructors that she can better align with in terms of her academic support needs. Okay. And then, is this an autism or disability-specific program? It is. The TRIO program has a number of components, but Nina's in it based on disability supports. Okay. Do they engage in any vocational activities as a part of the program? They have them. We've not engaged in them. She's not- Great. And then... Okay. And then is Nina taking classes with other students without disabilities? Yes. Okay. And then, is that for some of her classes, or all of them? All of her classes. Okay. And then, what type of school or program did Nina attend? So, it's... Okay. Just because there's three different programs, but the TRIO is a part of MATC as well. Is that correct? Correct. It's a federally-funded program that they're participating in there. Okay. And then, does Nina currently have an area of study? She does. She is in liberal arts. Okay. And what is the average number of classes Nina is taking per semester. She's taking an average of nine credit hours, or two classes a semester. Okay. Is that full, or part-time or other? Part time. Okay. And then, do you remember the month and year Nina started at this program? She started in June of 2019. So, immediately, upon exit of the regular high school, she started summer courses at Madison College and signed up with TRIO. Okay. And then, do you feel this program is a good fit? It's the best given the circumstances. Okay. And then, next, we'll just start moving into current or most recent job, and working back to the last time we spoke. So, she is currently working as a library page. Okay. And then, did DVR or Wisconsin DVR help find this job, but they don't provide support on site, but did they help with job opportunities, or not really, since you had mentioned that earlier. So, I'm going to... It was Wisconsin Promise. Okay. The Wisconsin Thomas program had not only created the internship options, they provided services or subcontracted services. So, Wisconsin Promise coordinated all of this, a DVR case manager who was working on the grant was assigned to Nina. Once the grant program was finished, she was sent back to Wisconsin DVR's standard program. And since then, it's almost been an absent without leave-kind of situation. Okay. And then, is Nina compensated for her hours at this job? Yes. She makes $10 and 71 cents an hour. Okay. And then, do you remember the month and year Nina started working? Oh, trying to remember if it was September of 2017. Okay. I think it was September of 2017. Nina started . She started the grants program in June of 2015, and yeah, September of 2017 at the Verona Library. Okay. Was this job or is this job a good fit for Nina's skills and interests? Why or why not? Excellent fit for Nina's skills and interests. It is a highly professional, very well-organized, consistent role that she is allowed to participate at her speed, I guess, as you know, Nina has a cadence. It doesn't slow down and it doesn't speed up. And she's treated with respect there. She is included as a team. She is treated as an intellectually-compatible individual in terms of meetings and memos. And so, it sets a bar for best practices, and it's given her a lot of confidence in a sense of autonomy. And I know that Nina is not the only one who come through the Wisconsin Promise program who is now employed at the Verona Library. So, this is an exceptional resource in terms of what they've chosen to do. Okay. And it's currently no longer being funded, right? Yeah. It's currently nonexistent? Yeah. That's a shame. Yeah. Okay. Because the aspect of the early intervention, to start that at 15, like at freshman year, the irony... And this just as an aside, the irony is that, for some reason, the standard DVA case manager did not know that Nina was in Wisconsin Promise program and didn't reach out to Nina until she was 17 and a half. So, that gap of that amount of time just, to me, was astounding. Also, the lack of communication was interesting. I believe it. I just want to clarify, on average, how many hours a week does Nina work at the library? On average, she works nine hours a week. Okay. I got that done. Thanks. And then, is she currently participating in any other employment, vocational or volunteering activities since the last interview in March? We're gearing up to return to the Badger Prairie Needs Network. The food pantry is another option where we can focus on her executive skills and integrate her into society where she can have, I think, a consistent experience. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, then, the last part of my interview with you is just to go over some of the goals that you had set with project ASSIST. So, we set three annual goals during the first visit, and the purpose of the goal development was to support families in helping youth pursue their dreams for the future, and really, start working on these goals. So, since the year has past, we just want to know how they've been doing with these goals. And then, we just want to recognize that we know a lot has happened in this past year, especially with things being so unpredictable at times. So, we understand that COVID might have imposed barriers to completing certain goals. Okay. The first goal was, within a year, giving access to a cooking class or a video of cooking demonstration, the youth chooses and prepares at least three meals per month. So, over the last year, how has she been doing with this goal? Great. That's been an easy one. On average, how many meals would you say that Nina prepares a week, at least? One. Okay. Oh, one a day. I'm sorry. Let me retract that a week. One a day. One meal a day. Okay. Okay. That's awesome. Okay. The second goal was, within a year, the youth participates in mock job interviews with an adult for three different job types. So, over the last year, how has she been doing with this goal? Hit or miss. Okay. You know, it's somewhat contingent on the resources on the other side. So, I've not been able to find consistent resources to give her that opportunity to do it. And I find that alternative voices are necessary in order for there to be a reasonable engagement. If you're always listening to your mother or you're always listening to your personal care provider, even if we're doing a mock interview, it's too familiar. So... And then... Okay. So, the goal was, within a year, they'll participate in mock interviews for three different job types. I mean, just thinking about like when things were really great, I mean, do you feel like Nina has been, or able to do the mock job interview with at least... Yeah. Oh yeah. ... one different job type or... Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Would you say she's made it to three different job types at any given point during the year? No. Okay. Okay. And then, the last goal was, within a year, youth follow steps to creating by following a plan about how to handle stress appropriately such as thinking of ways to relax, writing them down, and referring to the list when stressed with adult prompting. So, over the last year, how has she been doing with this goal? She's been doing great. Okay. Although forest bathing never went over well. Okay. So, just to obtain some more information about this goal, do you feel that Nina is able to do all the steps involved? So, thinking about ways to relax, and then, making, compiling a list of strategies, and then, you using that list to actually help her... So, I should say that the list is kind of an ongoing... The list is a consistent resource that she has access to. Okay. So, with a prompt, she's able to self-direct to either a mindfulness or a meditation, so she's got the list. That doesn't happen on the fly. So, it is a prearranged set of options. And then, it is just a prompt by a caregiver to say, what would you like to do? Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you for clarifying that. And then, is there anything else you want to tell us, or any other updates you wanted to share? I can't think of anything in particular that's germane at this point. Okay. I mean, I think that anything I have to share is probably going to be really similar to the feedback you're going to receive, which is, we're in a good place because of the quality of the community that we're in. We have found though that any resources to support her independently have really been difficult to find. And, you know, that we'll continue on this path until we're able to find a stronger, more structured resources for her. Okay. Yeah. I know. I have also... I mean, I also provide respite and have in the past, and I know it's just like, as soon as the pandemic broke out, I mean, my email was just flooded with families in need. And it was just like, I don't know, it was rough and I can't even imagine... You know, and- ... how that shortage was addressed, or if it ever was addressed. I don't feel like it has been addressed. I've done my best to... as a parent and a community member, you try to help people, but you have to be really protective of how much time you extend yourself into somebody else's life. Yeah. And I'm cognizant of not overreaching with my natural supports. We're lucky enough that we're in a place where we have some lovely natural supports. And I think that's what you call neighbors and friends who will provide some of that. But you're just careful, and you feel terrible for people that don't have that resource. Yeah. I wish there was a greater option to provide... I mean, I would like to have an accredited program where somebody could be a respite care worker, or they could come in and do supportive home care and they could garner some kind of academic or credential background so that it adds or accumulates, and it adds to their ability to move forward in their career. I think this is a really subtle and nuanced type of environment that takes somebody who is competent and willing to engage, but we do very little to reward them, and demonstrate that the competence has brought some... Gives them some accreditation, so they can advance into a career. Yeah. I would agree with that, and I've definitely heard that voiced many a time before. I just wanted to verify your email address and address to make sure we have it updated in our file. Mm-hmm . So, if you could provide your email address, and then, address, and then, I'll just make sure it's the same as what we have. Okay. So, I'm just looking to make sure that I'm consistent. Let's see. What did I provide to you? Yeah. So, it's . Yes. And then, address? 417 Cross Country Road, Verona 53593. Okay. Well, thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today. I mean, ASSIST would definitely not be possible without your participation. And then, as a reminder, we'll be sending an online survey for you to complete. And then, there's also a portion of this interview that Nina's going to complete. Right. And then, also... Sorry. I'm just... I know.\n",
            "finishSay about service access before we move on to the next part of the interview? Going to take my computer a minute to think again while it moves on to the next page. Okay, great. This page set up. So the last time we spoke, we discussed some activity Cyrus had been involved in and we'd like to hear what he's doing now. So we start everyone with high school. I know you said last time that Cyrus was out of high school. But just to double check, is he still receiving any services to the school system? No. Okay. Hold on. Sorry. My computer's having a moment of being confused. Okay. I see what happened. Okay, great. And did anything about Cyrus's high school track or plans change since the last time that we spoke? No. Okay. Do you remember the month and year that Cyrus exited high school? I believe it was it's July 2019. Okay. Yeah. And what kind of diploma did Cyrus receive? There's a little confusion with this. Okay. He was supposed to get the kind of diploma that shows he didn't fulfill all the credits. I forget what it's called, but he didn't take the... I'm forgetting the term for the type of courses that would make it a diploma that would be acceptable for secondary education. But then we received a diploma in the mail that seemed to be a regular full, so something to follow up on. Okay. Yeah. Carnegie credits. He didn't receive Carnegie credits. Okay. Great. Okay. So for the rest of the interview I'm going to ask you about academic programs, employment, or volunteering activities that Cyrus has done since January 29th, 2020. Last time we spoke. So first I just want to get a sense of how Cyrus spent his time. So what does a typical week look like for Cyrus? A typical week? Monday through Friday, he plays with his iPads. He works on jigsaw puzzles. We go for an outing, usually not too far away. But to an ice age trail or a city park or nearby park. What else? Yeah. There's... Oh, organizing, he's really gotten into organizing our house. Throwing away things that he thinks I don't need anymore. That's Monday through Friday. And I'm working Monday through Friday so I can't really do a lot more. Then on the weekends, we go for longer trips to trails that are farther away in Dan County or a little outside of Dan County. That's something that's new within the COVID times. Not since January 2020, but since March 2020. Yeah. Great. And on the weekends we do more baking and things like that. Great. So just to confirm, Cyrus is not doing any sort of educational, our volunteering activities right now? Okay. He is not happy about that. Okay. Yeah. Just making sure I get that down. Okay. So then post-secondary school programs. So has Cyrus... Sorry, I'm going to ask this, this way. Is Cyrus currently enrolled or has he been enrolled in any academic program at a vocational school, community college, college or university since January 2020? No. No. And then can you tell me about jobs or programs beginning with the current or most recent job he had since January 29th, 2020? Sometimes they do this where they ask the question and then it's immediately another question and I shouldn't ask it this way. So is Cyrus currently participating in any employment, vocational or volunteering activities? I know the answer to that is no. But has he done any of them since between January 2020, and now? Did he do any activities? Vocational, volunteering or educational? Yeah. From January to March when everything shut down because of COVID. He was working at DreamWeavers for six hours a week and going to advanced employment for... I'm forgetting how many hours was a week that was. Do you want me to calculate it in my head or do you not- An estimate would be helpful. Would say 30 hours a week. Is that right? Yeah. 30 hours a week. And what was the rest of the question? Should I list the kinds of things he did at advanced employment? Yes. Give me just a second to make sure that I'm doing this correctly. Yeah. So let's actually do sort of one at a time. DreamWeavers and then advanced employment. Okay. At DreamWeavers, can you describe the kind of employment that was? Was he receiving any supports for participating? Okay. Yes. He received job support from advanced employment. They went with him. He doesn't need help doing the work, but he sometimes gets into his internal world. And so they help him refocus. And was Cyrus paid for his work DreamWeavers? Yes. Yes. Okay. And how did he find that job? The MMSD West High out team, the Transition Team found that for him. Okay. And you said he did about six hours a week there? Do you remember the month and year that he started that job? I think it was June 2018. Was it even 2017? I think it was 2017. June 2017. 2017. Okay. And then you said that he left in March 2020 or sort of the- Stopped going in? Yeah. Yeah. Before COVID hit, do you think that job was a good fit for Cyrus's skills and interests? Pretty good fit. He needs more a challenge. I think that if he gets training, that they could give him work that's more challenging. But the shredding... There's a portion of it that's shredding, which he finds very tedious. Okay. Hold on. I know that there's a couple of questions where I think I already know the answer. So I don't want to ask you again. Okay. Now I'm going to talk about advanced employment. So they were supporting him to do his job at DreamWorks, but also providing- DreamWeavers. DreamWeavers. I thought he was working at DreamWorks, but he was- But they were also giving him other activities to do and teaching him skills. Is that right? I don't know about teaching him skills, but they did give him other activities. They had lots of games and puzzles in their facility. And then they took him out to Anytime Fitness gym, every day. And they also took him and other clients out for bowling once a week. So it was a really good fit. Yeah. Okay. And so I'm guessing if there's no... But just to make sure- Can you hold just a second? He's- Absolutely- At the door. Yeah. Okay. I'm back. You're good? Okay. Yeah. So I was saying, I think the answer would probably be no. But just to check, was Cyrus paid for working with advanced employment? No. No. Because he wasn't providing a service to them. They were providing a service to him. Right. I think advanced employment is paid through Cyrus's IRIS funds. Okay. And do you remember how he first got connected to advanced employment? Again, I think it was the Transition Team at the high school. I'm sure it was. Yeah, they were so wonderful. They really helped us get matched up with great services. Great. Do you remember the month and year that he first started working with advanced employment? I think that it was March 2019. Okay. That would've been that they were overlapping... The advanced employment team was overlapping with the high school Transition Team in Cyrus's last few months. Okay. High school. Can you hear a sigh in the background? I could. No. Okay. The headphones are working. Yeah. Okay. Okay. It's amazing how good they can be sometimes. I had a day where I was on Zoom meetings and Zoom calls all day and there were people cutting down a tree right outside my window. And everyone said they couldn't hear it at all. Yeah. Is it because you had the noise canceling on? No, it's just these little earbuds. But they just direct the sound enough. I don't know. Great. And you said earlier that you thought advanced employment was a good fit for Cyrus? Can you talk more about why you feel that way? The leadership and we met with the director to begin with and we've been in touch with her since. She has a lot of experience and has a... It's this attitude of compassion and respect that she has for the clients and for the on the frontline workers... Well, for all the workers. So it's a place that, I think, people want to work. And that makes us feel great about having to be in a place where the workers are seemly satisfied. And then the services that they offer... What Cy needs. And they are flexible. If he is having a hard time, they have little rooms with bean bag chairs. Or somebody can just chill out and take a nap if they want. But then there is a lot of social activity if they want that too. Great. And then they're responsible. They drive him to the gym and make sure he gets a good workout. So did that answer your question? Yes, definitely. And they're good communicators too. They're the people who are with him each day. And then there's someone who supervises them and then this person reports to the director. And anyway, the supervisor of the people who are with Cy is a good communicator with us.  Great. There's one thing that is an issue though, that I'm trying to figure out. And that's trying to find work for Cy that will challenge him more. But they don't have, I think, a lot of experience with finding that kind of work. So I've been taking more of a lead with it and I'm happy to do that. It's just I sure would like it if there was someone who's a little more experienced at it. So that I'm not feeling kind of like I'm inventing the wheel. Yeah. So I'll be talking with them about that more. Great. Thanks for all that information. Any other employment, vocation, or volunteering activities that we've missed? No, I don't... He had volunteered at Catholic charities, but I think he had stopped volunteering in January 2020. Yeah. Why did he stop volunteering there? Trying to remember. It used to be a paid position then it went to volunteer. I do not remember. He would go back again either as a volunteer or in person. I'm trying to remember if it was a scheduling thing. I could ask my husband. Yeah. If that would be helpful? I don't think it's very important. I just wanted to ask in case it was something relevant. But yeah, you don't need to follow up with anyone or anything. Okay. Great. We're getting to the end. Is there anything else you want to tell us or any other updates you want to share? Let's see. No, I don't think so. Okay. I know so many things about Cyrus that I would love to share because I love talking about him. But I'm thinking is any of this relevant to what you're asking, so I guess not. Okay. And I know you sort of implied earlier, before we started recording, that maybe you had some questions about the study itself that you maybe can't ask me, so that I don't know information about what activities you've done. But Sarah Bubash is the person a step above me who should be emailing with you in the next couple of days to kind of follow up after this interview. So if there are any concerns she would be the person to ask those to, to make sure that you know what's up. Or if there are any issues, you can tell her about that. Before I let you go, I just want to clarify or make sure I have your right contact information. I know we've been emailing, is that email still the best place to contact you over email? Right. Right. The lambert.jane@gmail.com is the best. There was that confusion about it going to my work email. But I think we got it straightened out. And if it did go to my work email, it's not a huge deal. I just want to kind of keep them separate if I can. Yeah. And mailing address. Has your mailing address been updated at all? It's the same. It's still 4910 Eyre Ln, Madison. Great. Okay. Well that's it then. So thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us today, any of this would not be possible without your participation. Oh, I'm so glad that we're involved and I'll look forward to Sarah's email. Great. Yeah. Yeah. That'll be the next step. She'll contact you. Okay. Have a good rest of your day- Hope I didn't say anything wrong. Nope. It was great. You did a great job. Okay. All right. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye.\n"
